	abstract		= {{PDC} drill bit performances in hard rock has been greatly improved during the last decades by innovations in {PDC} wear, impact resistance and better vibrations understanding. The bit design is generally done by balancing the bit, distributing uniform wear along the profile and achieving high drillability and steerability. To obtain required drilling performances, drill bit designer adjust features such as profile shape, gage and mainly cutter characteristics (shape, type and orientation). Cutter rock interaction model became a critical feature in the design process. But previously used models considered only three forces on a cutter based on the cutter-rock contact area: drag force, normal force and side force. Such models are no longer valid with the introduction of {PDC} cutters with chamfer and special shape.  This paper presents a new cutter rock interaction model including some several improvements. It is based on the presence of a build-up edge of crushed materials on the cutting face often described in the literature. In addition, the chamfer, which significantly affects bit Rate Of Penetration (ROP), is taken into account (shape and size). Forces applied on the back of the cutter and due to the rock deformation and back flow of crushed materials are considered in the model. Finally, results of numerous single cutter tests (under atmospheric and confining pressure) are presented and compared to the new cutter rock interaction model predictions. An analysis of the influence of the {PDC} characteristics (shape, size, chamfer, back and side rake angles, \ldots{}.) is presented.  The model has been applied to optimize the cutting efficiency and bit steerability and some design rules are given to minimize the specific energy and maximize the rate of penetration. Finally, full scale laboratory drilling tests and field results indicate that the use of accurate cutter rock interaction model can help the drill bit designer to find the best drill bit for a specific application. Standard laboratory full scale drilling procedures have been developed. The tests have shown that drillability, stability, steerability and wear can be improved and controlled by acting on the cutter characteristics, cutter setup, trimmer characteristics and gage type.}

	abstract		= {Rock cutting by an advancing drilling Polycrystalline Diamond Compact cutter poses a serious challenge from a modeling perspective. This is especially true with finite element analysis. In this study, the explicit finite element code LS-DYNA was employed. The study first looked into the merits and shortcomings of various approaches ranging from the Eulerian and ALE formulation, to the Lagrange formulation, with only the last one to be suitable for the present study. These different numerical approaches are evaluated in terms of their ability to give reasonable cutting forces, and the resolution and extent of the fragmentation process captured. The basic rock cutting model investigated was fashioned after the laboratory linear rock scratching test. This study has successfully modeled the various fracture phases of the fragmentation in rock cutting, from crack initiation, chip formation, and to the interactions of chips, cutter, and the rock sample. The magnitudes of cutting forces obtained were also consistent with laboratory tests.  The present study is part of a comprehensive effort in developing a reliable methodology to study the mechanics of rock cutting. This paper presents the findings from the FEM perspective using LS-DYNA [1], while results from a parallel study using the discrete element method are discussed in a companion paper [2]. Rock cutting is a challenging task from modeling perspective. This challenge appears as a sequence of difficult problems: A contact problem first arises as a cutter advances and interacts with the target rock material. This is followed by the problem of determining when and whether or not the rock would fail. Subsequently, the problem of how to initiate the fragmentation process after the material failure has to be resolved. This cycle of problems then repeats starting with a new contact problem after new surfaces are generated because of fracture. These layers of difficult problems may well be the reason why a literature search did not find prior FEM work of rock cutting modeling that follows a cutter through a complete cutting process. The various approaches are then discussed and explored. The relevance of the material modeling is also touched upon. The use of \textquotedblleft{}element erosion\textquotedblright{}, in modeling fracture without using special types of elements, circumvents the difficulty of no a priori knowledge of failure modes. Some general issues of mesh preparation for rock cutting are also discussed. Finally, the validation of cutting forces and failure mechanisms using laboratory scratching test results [3] is presented. When simulating problems involving impact and fracturing, the typical Lagrangian mesh-based technique of the FEM, although powerful in tracking element properties and in incorporating complex material models, has limitations such as: (i) Inability to use a simple but realistic automatic crack propagation formulation in complex geometry particularly with interacting cracks;(ii) Numerical instabilities caused by local mesh distortions due to highly concentrated loads, especially in dynamic large deformation analysis; and, (iii) High computational costs and loss of accuracy when implementing adaptivity or remeshing procedures to reduce mesh entangling.}

	abstract		= {For half a century, the oil and gas drilling industry has used compressive strength and friction angle to parameterize Mohr-Coulomb-like constitutive relations in attempts to model the drilling process. Rates of penetration based on these models underpredict the effect of pressure on drilling. This suggests that there must be other rock properties that govern drilling under pressure. Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) of high pressure rock cutting indicates that mechanical properties of crushed rock detritus are more important than the mechanical properties of the original elastic rock. The deformation and extrusion of crushed rock detritus consumes the bulk of the energy expended in rock cutting down hole. These results suggest that some measure of the inelastic behavior of rock under pressure, such as the area under the stress strain curve, may be a more appropriate measure of rock drillability in high pressure environments. The area under a stress strain curve is a measure of specific energy. Characterizing rock in terms of the area under the stress strain curve may open the door to more accurate ways to parameterize specific energy models of drilling. 1 HISTORY OF MODELING OF ROCK DRILLABILITY During the early part of the twentieth century, the drilling community did not account for the strengthening effect of downhole pressure on rock. K\``{u}hne (1952) pointed out the effect of pressure and suggested that rock may be treated as a Mohr-Coulomb material. Research conducted at Rice University explored the ramifications of K\''{u}hneâ€™s proposal. (Bredthauer 1955, Cunningham 1955, Galle 1959). Similar research spread rapidly through the industry. This early research showed that the most important factor governing drillability downhole is the differential pressure, defined as the difference between the pressure of the mud in the borehole (borehole pressure) and the pressure in the pores of the rock (pore pressure).},

	abstract		= {Deep-hole drillstring vibrations are an important cause of premature failure of drillstring components and drilling inefficiency. {PDC} bits are more susceptible to the stick-slip phenomenon characterized by intense RPM fluctuations of the drill bit. Based on full scale laboratory drilling tests and numerical simulations, this paper aims at understanding the dynamic behaviour of the bit/rock interaction and assessing how stick-slip depends on bit design (bit profile and diameter; cutters geometry and set up). It is generally assumed in the scientific and technical literature that forces acting on {PDC} cutters do not depend on cutter velocity. However, an extensive single cutter experimental program shows that these forces are rate-dependent for four tested carbonate rocks. This rate-effect is associated with the dynamic shearing of a layer of crushed rock carried away beneath the moving cutter. Based on these experiments, a semi-empirical rate-dependent cutter-rock interaction model is developed, implemented in a bit design software and used to predict the velocity signature of various {PDC} bit designs. These predictions fit well with numerous experimental results obtained using a full scale drilling bench. In particular, the model accounts for the negative damping effect, considered as the main source of stick-slip, and for important operational trends like an increasing risk of stick-slip in harder rocks, at higher weights-on-bit or for advanced cutter wear. The bit-rock interaction model is used as the boundary condition of a drillstring vibration software designed to perform a time-domain analysis of lumped systems. Simulations show that the bit design significantly impacts the risk of stick-slip. As a result, general optimization guidelines are suggested in order to improve {PDC} bit design.}

	abstract		= {{PDC} bit designs for directional drilling typically sacrifice penetration rate for steering performance, resulting in a higher cost per foot. This paper discusses a process for modeling the drilling behavior of {PDC} bits, insights gained regarding bit efficiency when steering with various motorized and non-motorized rotary steerable systems (RSS), and field experience with the resulting bit design.  Prediction and analyses of {PDC} bit behavior used a bridgeable software platform to integrate various design applications. This allowed the combined analyses of performance objectives and criteria, including cutting structure, rock type, application, well profiles, drives, and {3D} contact. Simulations were then run to examine the performance of different cutting structures relative to various drilling parameters, and matched to a specific drive system. An optimized {PDC} bit design was developed and manufactured, and its field performance was compared to the model and to {PDC} bit performance in offset wellbores.  The optimized design was manufactured in a 6 1/8-in {PDC} bit and run on motorized and non-motorized RSS. It resulted in significant ROP increases and a lower cost per foot compared to offset wells, while retaining a high level of steering response. In one well, the ROP was increased to 48.43 ft/hr versus a target of 35 ft/hr based on offset performance. The resulting cost per foot was reduced from \$11.40 KD to \$8.59 KD.  The paper examines bit performance and dull condition for the runs and compares them with offset runs. Field performance results validate the bit design modeling and simulation process, and emphasize the importance of integrating various performance analyses to improve bit efficiency without degrading critical steering characteristics.  Extensive development of cutting structures that ``drilled on paper'' combined with full scale bit laboratory testing has resulted in the development of a design process that combines multiple design objectives and criteria to model and simulate bit behavior during drilling. As shown by field results, this process of balancing the design provides the means to optimize overall performance and lower costs for many different bit applications.}

Good agreement between the simulation and the lab is demonstrated.  Using this dynamic drilling simulation software, a common directional drilling challenge\textemdash{}holding tool face orientation\textemdash{}is investigated. The case is made that tool face control problems can be caused by dynamically unstable drill bits in addition to commonly cited causes. The software is used to simulate the dynamic behavior of 21 bits from the field that had been used on motors with bent AKO. Bits with excellent tool face control in the field are found to be more dynamically stable than bits with poor tool face control. The link between instability and tool face control problems is shown to be the increased torque that accompanies dynamic instability, or bit whirl. The relationship is illustrated with two case studies\textemdash{}one in southern Texas and one in central Oklahoma. Both case studies examine tool face performance in the field using the enhanced simulation software.}

This paper presents the results of comparing such a model to laboratory drilling tests for four radically different bit designs in four different rocks. The geometry of each cutter on the bit was determined by detailed measurements of the bit with a three-axis coordinate measuring machine. Drilling tests were conducted by ``reaming'' rock with an 8\textonehalf{}-in. [21.6-cm] bit that was previously drilled with a 6\textonequarter{}-in. [15.9-cm] bit. Only the peripheral cutters engaged the rock during reaming. Additional tests were conducted in which the WOB and torque were recorded during drilling of a pilot hole into the top of a flat rock and during drilling through two different bed boundaries with constant ROP. The model predictions compared well to the measured data for both the reaming and pilot-hole tests.}

Quantitative techniques in log segmentation aim at providing a measurable control on the zonation and automation of the process. A procedure for segmenting digital well-log data using maximum likelihood estimation is presented along with the algorithm and a FORTRAN-77 program. The method is based on a univariate state variable model in which the state (signal) changes by a random amount at, and only at, the segment boundary. The observed log value is the sum of the state and random noise. The noise is modeled as Gaussian, but not necessarily stationary. The inverse problem of log segmentation is one of detecting the segment boundaries, and estimating the signal within the segment from a given log. These are solved by an iterative application of Kalman filtering and Single Most Likelihood Replacement (SMLR) techniques of Estimation theory. The technique is illustrated with a case study comprising of multisuite log data from an exploratory well. Different experiments on the performance of the algorithm are discussed. The method is robust and the resulting segments are determined to be geologically consistent.},

	abstract		= {The oil-and-gas industry has become increasingly interested in drilling dynamics and vibration as causes of drilling inefficiency and reduced drilling performance. Generally, drillstring vibration is measured with shock-and-vibration sensors installed in measurement-while-drilling (MWD) tools, logging-while-drilling (LWD) tools, and rotary steerable systems (RSS). Although these tools provide valuable real-time and recorded-mode information on the dynamic conditions, they are not generally designed to capture continuous high-frequency (HF) mechanics and dynamics data, and burst data may miss important information about the evolution of the system response and state.  A downhole mechanics measurement tool has been developed that makes a comprehensive suite of measurements of the drilling process, including forces, accelerations, rotational speed, pressures, and temperatures. In addition to providing information in real time, the tool has the capability to capture long durations of continuous data at frequencies between 50 and 2,000\hspace{0.167em}Hz. The recorded-mode information obtained has provided significant insight into the response of the drilling system to starting rotation; drilling procedures and parameter modifications; and exposure to excitation from sources including, but not limited to, rig heave, bottomhole-assembly ({BHA}) component imbalance, and bit/rock interaction. A wide range of occurrences has been captured in which the drilling system switches from a dominant vibration mode, typically torsional (downhole rotation-velocity oscillations or stick/slip) into a different mode, such as axial (bit bounce) or lateral (whirl). Transitions between different types of whirl have also been recorded.  Several cases were studied to investigate the evolution and response of drilling-system behavior on the basis of in-depth interpretation of relatively long durations (minutes to hours) of HF data sets in the operational context. The findings verify the value of using continuous HF vibration data to understand the drilling system and to increase drilling performance.}

	abstract		= {Downhole vibration is detrimental to drilling efficiency and can cause MWD/LWD tool failure, drillstring fatigue, bit/PDM damage. Preventing or mitigating {BHA} instability is critical to improve drilling efficiency, increase ROP and reduce drilling costs. To prevent dynamic instability requires an in-depth understanding of the {BHA}'s downhole behavior in terms of the actual phenomenon and ability to determine root cause. Downhole RPM and vibration data sent to surface from MWD/LWD usually have very low frequency limited by telemetry. Because vibrations are measured at a distance from the bit, the data may not capture detailed bit behavior patterns. The low frequency data is typically used in combination with steady-state response or static analysis models developed to predict interaction between the drillstring and wellbore. Results produced by these type systems have been less than optimal.  To obtain superior quality downhole vibration data, a high-frequency drilling dynamics measurement module (DDMM) was recently developed to capture and measure bit/{BHA} dynamic response. The authors will describe the application of the new module to measure and record downhole RPM, acceleration at bit/{BHA} at sampling frequencies up to 2048-Hz. Analysis verified the high-frequency data produces more specific details about dynamic behavior compared to standard data. The module can be positioned at any location within the {BHA} or directly above the bit.  The high-frequency data is used in conjunction with a unique time-based dynamic simulation system to verify and confirm the modeling's prediction of ROP/RPM, acceleration and drillstring instability including stick-slip/whirl. When drilling dysfunction is observed, the time-based modeling system has the potential to ascertain the root cause not typically identified in measured data. This system approach is cost effective and can be highly effective at preventing or mitigating complex instability issues. Three DDMM field tests are presented that document the capability of the combined testing and modeling system approach to achieve better understanding of downhole dynamics:Rotary {BHA} with one DDMM positioned at top of bit. Analysis of actual downhole data from DDMM shows large RPM variation at the bit which was confirmed by the time-based modeling system. The two data plots showed good correlation between axial/lateral acceleration (acceleration/g's vs time/sec).  Motor {BHA} with two DDMMs installed. One positioned at top of motor another at top of the bit. Analysis of actual data documents stick-slip at the bit and top of motor which is confirmed by the modeling system. Detailed analysis of the two data plots revealed good correlation between actual and modeled data with both depicting negative RPM at the top of the motor with increased acceleration at the occurrence of stick-slip (RPM vs time/sec).  Motor {BHA} with two DDMMs installed. One positioned at top of motor, another at top of bit. Analysis of actual data documents stick slip at the top of motor which was confirmed by the modeling system. Further analysis of the modeling data plot identified stick-slip coupled with {BHA} whirl.  The case studies document accurate modeling predictions of ROP/RPM and acceleration corroborated by the measured data. Modeling also successfully predicted dynamic instability issues identified by actual DDMM measurement and gave specific details about coupling of stick-slip and {BHA} whirl not observed in the measured data.}

	abstract		= {Recent advances in downhole vibration monitoring have enabled detection of high-frequency torsional oscillations (HFTO) of drilling systems in the field. The general understanding of torsional behavior of drilling systems derived from elaborate efforts in the literature does not explain the mechanism responsible for HFTO. Even for the well-known and extensively studied stick/slip vibrations, the mechanism perpetuating the vibrations is not agreed upon by researchers.  The paper discusses findings from experimental and analytical studies regarding the HFTO of bottomhole assemblies ({BHA}s). The phenomenon is investigated and reproduced in field tests, full-scale laboratory tests, and computer modeling. Drilling conditions are identified in which the drilling system is prone to exhibit the vibrations. Interaction of the bit and the drilling system, which can generate self-excited vibrations, is investigated using analytical methods. Cutter-rock interaction as a possible excitation source is studied using laboratory experiments to elucidate its interaction with the system.  The integrated analysis investigating rock, cutter, bit, and {BHA} interaction identifies HFTO as a bit-induced {BHA} torsional resonance that can occur at vibration modes higher than the fundamental mode of the {BHA}. It is demonstrated that modes most susceptible to exhibiting HFTO can be identified and the dominant mode predicted. The understanding gained can be employed to mitigate torsional resonance and enhance drilling performance.}

	abstract		= {A distributed model of a drill string is presented, with Coulomb stiction as a distributed source term, to investigate the effect of borehole inclination and borehole friction on the incidence of torsional vibrations along a drill-string. To isolate the effect of this distributed friction, only cases where the bit is off bottom and with no axial movement are considered, and consequently a purely torsional model is used. The model is used to study the stick slip limit cycle, as caused by distributed Coulomb friction, and the limit-cycle period and amplitude dependence on the friction parameters is derived. This enables the qualitative limit-cycle behavior to be characterized as inertia or stick dominated, and examples of this characterization is validated with the field data. For comparison, high frequency field data from two deviated wells from surface and downhole sensors are considered. Time-series are isolated where angular rotation is restarted after a connection, with the bit off bottom and before axial motion is re-initiated, to make the data consistent with the model assumptions. A close match is obtained between recorded and modeled downhole data, however, in some cases either the initial torsional strain in the drillstring is not known or axial motion is initiated, which violates model assumptions, causing a mismatch.}

The influence of various drill string and bit parameters on the stability of bit motion is studied through their effect on the size of the stability zone on (rev/min)/WOB plots.

	abstract		= {The use of lubricants is commonplace when drilling with water-based drilling fluids. They are less frequently applied when drilling with non-aqueous fluids, as the oil-based drilling fluid is thought to impart a high lubricity.  With increased reach of the wells, lubricants are also applied in non-aqueous fluids (NAF) to reduce torque and drag at high angle, for extended reach and horizontal wells to improve drilling efficiency. However, the performance of these lubricants in NAF at extended periods of elevated temperature at downhole conditions is often inconsistent, thought to be hampered by ineffective metal binding and hydrolytic instability of the lubricant molecule. This requires frequent re-dosing and therefore higher cost to maintain performance.  In order to identify a better-performing lubricant, it was necessary to better understand the fundamentals of lubrication in a drilling fluid. For example, what portion of the well contributes most to torque and drag? What is the frictional regime that dominates the lubricity between a drill pipe and its contact points?Looking at theoretical analysis and modeling, it was found that the horizontal portion is dominated by the boundary and mixed layer friction regime, which is a combination of surface forces and fluid viscosity. Additionally, understanding of tribology from other industrial applications was employed to better design a molecule that can deliver optimum lubricity in a NAF.  This new understanding led to identifying an optimized lubricant for NAF. A lubricant derived from a plant-based raw material was specifically designed to be chemically and thermally stable, binding strongly to metal surfaces, and providing a tenacious film that reduces metal-to-metal friction factors during drilling, casing run and other completion operations.  The identified lubricant was tested for compatibility with NAF, including effects on rheology, elastomers, and formation damage potential. Coefficients of friction and fluid rheology comparisons and research-related field trials are presented. The results show significant (20\%) reduction in the coefficient of friction after treatment, especially after hot-rolling, indicating thermal and oxidative stability of the product.}

	abstract		= {A major challenge that is being occasionally faced during the well construction phase is to cement the formations holding narrow pressure margins between the pore and fracture gradients without inducing losses. Losses can commonly occur in these cases, compromising the integrity of the cement barrier. Designed slurry densities generally lead to high equivalent circulating density (ECD) levels during the cementing operations. This condition, combined with mud weights conventionally designed to be above pore pressure, usually results in downhole pressures which approach or exceed the fracture limit. Commonly, operators implement strategies to mitigate losses during the cementing phase, however, in most cases the losses are unavoidable using a conventional cementing approach. Managed pressure cementing (MPC) is an important technique for primary cementing operations in wells with such narrow pressure margins.  This paper presents the design considerations, methodology and results of a land well where high-pressure influx was encountered while drilling an 8-3/8-in hole across a water-bearing formation. Narrow pressure gradient persuaded to utilize managed pressure drilling (MPD) to continue the drilling. The well was drilled to the target depth using 138-lbm/ft3 oil-based drilling fluid while maintaining the ECD from 146.5 to 149.5 lbm/ft3. Careful attention was paid to estimate the bottom hole circulating temperature, using the temperature modeling simulator. A 150-lbm/ft3 slurry was designed to keep the ECD intact. The slurry was batch-mixed to ensure the homogeneity of the final slurry mixture. A special spacer system was designed to reduce the losses while cementing. Additionally, the spacer was loaded with optimum amounts of surfactant package to serve as an aid to remove the mud and to water-wet the formation and pipe for better cement bonding. The centralizers placement plan was optimized, and additionally the liner was rotated during the cement job to achieve the required displacement efficiency yet staying within the torque and drag (T\&D) limits. The cement treatment was performed as designed and met all zonal isolation objectives.  The managed pressure cementing (MPC) system provides safe isolation of problematic zones in cost effective manner even in challenging narrow pressure window scenarios. The system provides precise control of the pressure and flow during and after the cement job. Constant pressure can be achieved at weak zones, preventing losses to the formation.  This case study presents an overview of the engineering process used to plan and design the MPC operations and the results obtained. This paper reviews a successful MPC operation and presents findings and lessons learnt. After the successful results on this job and subsequent operations, this technique is now being adopted to optimize cementing, where losses during cementing operations in the past had forced to modify the well construction.}

	abstract		= {There is considerable value in automatically quantifying cutter damage from drill bit pictures. Current approaches do not classify cutter damage by type, i.e., broken, chipped, lost, etc. We, therefore, present a computer vision model using deep learning neural networks to automate multi-type damage detection in Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) drill bit cutters.  The automated bit damage detection approach presented in this paper is based on training a computer vision model on different cutter damage types aimed at detecting and classifying damaged cutters directly. Prior approaches detected cutters first and then classified the damage type for the detected cutters. The You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) algorithm was selected based on the findings of an earlier published study. Different models of YOLOv5 were trained with different architecture sizes with various optimizers using two-dimensional (2D) drill bit images provided by the SPE Drilling Uncertainty Prediction technical section (DUPTS) and labeled by the authors with training from industry subject matter experts. To achieve the modeling goal, the images were first annotated and labeled to create training, validation, and testing sub-datasets. Then, by changing brightness and color, the images allocated for the training phase were augmented to generate more samples for the model development. The categories defined for labeling the DUPTS dataset were bond failure, broken cutter, chipped cutter, lost cutter, worn cutter, green cutter, green gauge, core out, junk damage, ring out, and top view. These categories can be updated once the IADC upgrade committee finishes upgrading IADC dull bit grading cones.  Trained models were validated using the validation dataset of 2D images. It showed that the large YOLOv5 with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer achieved the highest metrics with a short training cycle compared to the Adam optimizer. In addition, the model was tested using an unseen data set collected from the local office of a drill bit supplier. Testing results illustrated a high level of performance. However, it was observed that inconsistency and quality of rig site drill bit photos reduce model accuracy. Therefore, it is suggested that companies produce large sets of quality images for developing better models. This study successfully demonstrates the integration of computer vision and machine learning for drill bit grading by categorizing/classifying damaged cutters by type directly in one stage rather than detecting the cutters first and then classifying them in a second stage. To guarantee the deployed model's robustness and consistency the model deployment has been tested in different environments that include cloud platform, container on a local machine, and cloud platform as a service (PaaS) with an online web app. In addition, the model can detect ring out and cored damages from the top view drill bit images, and to the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this has not been addressed by any study before.  The novelty of the developed deep learning computer vision algorithm is the ability to detect different cutter damage types in a fast and efficient process compared to the current lengthy manual damage evaluation practice. Furthermore, the trained model can detect damages that frequently take place in more than one blade of the bit such as ring outs and coring. In addition, a user-friendly interface was developed that generates results in pdf and CSV file formats for further data analysis, visualization, and documentation. Also, all the technologies used in the development of the model are open source and we made our web app implementation open access.}

	abstract		= {Core analysis, if conducted successfully, can provide accurate assessment of the original reservoir fluid properties, however, it is challenging to retrieve an uncontaminated core, due to mud components contaminating the fluids originally present in the reservoir. Due to invasion, the liquid extracted from the cores, does not necessarily represent the native liquid, but rather a mixture of drilling and reservoir fluid, thus affecting the results, conclusions and decisions that were based on the analysis. Therefore, deploying advanced water-based mud (WBM) tracers, during coring operations, can mitigate this issue and lead to a significant cost-reduction in field development.  Tracer technology is an efficient monitoring and surveillance tool, that was proven to help in tracking and understanding the injection flow paths, and estimating the remaining oil saturation (Sor) in the reservoir, through inter-well and single-well tracer tests. Utilizing water-based tracers in the drilling mud, during coring operation, can help in quantifying the degree of invasion in the retrieved cores, therefore proper correction and more accurate assessment of the reservoir rock and fluid properties, can be made.  The accuracy of the data plays a pivotal role in guiding the way forward and the future development of oilfield projects. A WBM tracer was utilized in the drilling mud, during the sidetracking of an observation well at the first and largest CO2-Project in the middle east. The objective of sidetracking the well was to obtain sponge core samples to assess the residual oil saturation (ROS) and evaluate the sweep efficiency of the CO2-flood.  This report provides an overview of tracer technologies and the lessons learnt from deploying advanced water-based mud (WBM) tracers during the coring operation of a CO2 observation well, including theoretical and experimental considerations, engineering design and field test issues. The objective of this tracer survey was to estimate the invasion of the drilling mud-filtrate and correct water saturations. It will be useful to use this deployment in some of the relatively mature fields, however, it may have some limitations and challenges that need to be addressed first.}

	abstract		= {This paper presents the results of a study showing that the most harmful polycrystalline-diamond-compact (PDC) bit vibrations can be attributed to a phenomenon called 'bit whirl.'  During whirl, the instantaneous center of rotation moves around the face of the bit, and the bit whirls backward around the hole. Cutters on a whirling bit can move sideways, backward, and much faster than those on a true rotating bit. The impact loads associated with this motion cause PDC cutters to chip, which, in turn, accelerates wear. Laboratory and field results show the detrimental effects of whirl on PDC bit rate of penetration (ROP) and life.}

	abstract		= {Currently, real-time adjustments to drilling parameters such as weight on bit (WOB), drillstring revolutions per minute (RPM), flow rate, etc., are based primarily on experience. This is mainly due to the uncertain nature of information (both downhole and surface) available and inability of humans to aggregate multiple data streams in real-time to make optimal decisions. The objective therefore is to build a decision support tool that can overcome these limitations by automatically aggregating this data, identifying drilling inefficiency and suggesting optimal drilling parameters.  The methodology presented in this paper uses a Bayesian network to represent the drilling process and is capable of representing uncertainty in a way that is robust to bad sensor data. The model is updated in real-time and tracks variations in drilling conditions. Various dysfunctions such as bit balling, bit bounce, whirl, torsional vibrations, high mechanical specific energy (MSE), auto-driller erratic behavior, etc., are identified by tracking the movement characteristics of various sensor data in relation to model predicted values. A holistic drilling optimization index is thus derived by aggregating all this information. This index coupled with the drilling dysfunction prediction ultimately enables recommendation of drilling parameter corrections.  The drilling optimization index has been integrated into a drilling rig data aggregation system currently in operation on twenty rigs in North America. The system has access to real-time data, both at low frequency (less than 1 Hz) as well as data in the 1 to 10 Hz range, and also contextual data (such as data typically available in a tour sheet or well plan). In deploying the system, human factors aspects were given significant consideration. A typical driller is not familiar with concepts such as Bayesian networks, MSE, etc. By displaying the effectiveness of drilling as a single, dimensionless parameter, an index that varies between 0 and 1, with 0 representing inefficient drilling and 1 representing optimal drilling, the message is effectively communicated to the driller. The index is currently depicted in a very intuitive "speedometer" type of visual. Values are low and closer to 0 when dysfunctions occur, and when that happens suggestions are provided on how to mitigate the dysfunctions. These suggestions are visually presented in the form of operational cones in the WOB-RPM space. Additionally, the variation of the index with drilling depth is displayed to enable the driller to identify how formation changes impact drilling performance. This was found to be useful to drilling engineers who are generally tasked with optimizing the drilling process.},

	abstract		= {Tripping operations can take up a significant portion of well construction time and the associated cost. In the last decade, there has been extensive development and deployment of real-time tripping applications to optimize tripping parameters while maintaining formation integrity. This paper presents a system that utilizes transient modeling of tripping behavior to determine the optimum parameters that safeguard the integrity of the formation and the mechanical equipment at the rig site. The system delivers tripping boundaries to automated drilling control systems (ADCS) for every stand.  A digital twin of the wellbore, equipped with physics-based transient models, estimates the permissible axial velocities and accelerations developed when running drillstring in and out the wellbore. These motions develop pressure waves which travel along the wellbore and which can compromise formation integrity. The digital twin, prepared in the planning phase and deployed in the real-time drilling environment, uses smart triggering algorithms to automatically update the models and refine simulation results. Automation systems consume the predicted limits via an aggregation layer to refine fit-for-purpose tripping applications. The automation system finds optimum proposals of tripping limits and updates them directly in the rig control system in real-time.  The trip monitoring system automatically and continuously publishes optimum velocity and acceleration tripping limits per stand and transmits them as set points to the ADCS to define a safe operating envelope (SOE). This approach can greatly reduce the overall tripping time in comparison to non-automated deployments. Furthermore, the reduction of invisible lost time (ILT) takes place while maintaining the integrity of the formation, and the integrity of the surface equipment. Finally, reduction of the energy required to perform the tripping process consequently decreases the amount of carbon emissions involved in the process.  A set of case studies confirm the effectiveness of the approach and illustrate its benefits. A case study addresses the topic of adoption of drilling automation applications such as the tripping advisor. Another case presents the concept of interoperability using as example a deployment on a rig simulator setup in Europe to perform closed-loop control using the tripping application to write velocity and acceleration limits continuously to the ADCS.}

	abstract		= {Over the last years, the use of autonomous solutions for balancing the loading on the drill-bit has increased annually. By 2021, downhole tools for this purpose have been used for more than 1,500 wells and these become possibly the fastest growing trend in drilling. Polycrystaline Diamond Compact (PDC) drill-bits represent a great potential for drilling economics when steady cutting is attainable. Deep drilling, however, typically involves long drillstring causing an array of dynamic instabilities preventing steady cutting conditions at the bit. Such behavior affects drilling performance in terms of the rate-of-penetration (ROP) and system damage and failure. This leaves a big potential for improvement of drilling performance. The first experiments with an autonomous downhole regulator constructed were completed at Ulrigg in Stavanger almost twenty years ago to tap into this potential. Several versions of similar tools have since developed using a variety of mechanical and hydraulic functions to modify and shift the forces acting on the drill-bit in order to improve drilling performance.  The Norwegian operator Equinor has participated from the very start of this new automation trend. By 2020 they had deployed downhole regulators to a total of 93 well sections on the Norwegian Continental Shelf alone. In this paper, Equinor shares statistic plots from comparing these first 93 sections to well section with conventional BHA's. The data show how the continuous improvement of the regulator eventually led to gradual improvement of both ROP and footage - in addition to its initial task of reducing vibrations. By utilizing a variety of dynamic models, predictions and sensitivity analysis, it has been revealed that the downhole regulator could change the dynamic response of the bit such that the friction losses at the bit are reduced and the rock cutting efficiency is improved. In this paper, it is shown that such benefits can also be expected in real-life scenarios in which two key aspects play a role: 1) a PDC bit penetrating heterogeneous layers of rock formations, and 2) involving two frictional losses due to borehole - drillstring contact in deviated wells.  This paper brings a unique insight to the fundamentals, advanced mathematical models, and statistical results from a new line of drilling technology. The autonomous regulators bring a combination of reduction in risk and time to drill that makes a significant impact on cost.}

Problems that can result from improper matching include vibration, inability to open hole, mechanical damage to string tools or to the bit, and sub-optimal drilling performance.  This paper explores the theoretical relationship between bit and reamer and modeling the relative aggressivity and stability of both tools, building on already established indices for predicting and comparing the performance of bits. It reviews the calculations and methodology of placement and development of both the bit and reamer for optimal interaction and performance. It also considers stabilization of the hole opening tool using both concentric and eccentric devices.  The paper also reveals the development of an interactive, intranet tool. This software incorporates logic regarding the configuration of the reamer and assesses these against key characteristics of the drill bit. The tool enables the user to accurately select the drill bit that best complements the reamer that will be utilized.  A number of examples from global applications are presented. These demonstrate reduced vibration, improved hole quality and hole opening performance, superior penetration rates, and overall significantly reduced drilling costs.}

For several years of research, high power lasers have been proven in the lab to create controllable perforation tunnels with enhanced flow properties. This paper presents the strategy of lab to field transformations to perforate horizontal well with two inches in diameter by twenty four inches deep at 10,000 feet in horizontal well.  High power laser is an alternative and innovative technology to currently used shaped charge perforation. Lasers are advanced in several industries for their several unique properties such as power, precision, control and reliability, with these properties; controllable non-damaged enhanced oriented perforated tunnels are achieved. Laser power can be adjusted precisely to control the depth of the tunnel; the tool can be oriented to create perforation in any direction regardless of the reservoir stress orientations as lasers are stress independent.  Shale, Sandstones (including tight sandstones) and carbonate rocks have been perforated at different conditions, the result from all rock types showed improvement in permeability and creation of controlled geometry without any compactions or damage. The success of the lab experiments lead to field deployment strategy to create the first in the industry laser perforation at 10,000 feet. Lab to field transformation is presented at different stages, first prove of concept, then design and test lab prototype tool, followed by improved field upscale downhole tool.  High power laser in downhole is a safe (non-explosive) perforation technology. The geometry, depth and orientation can be controlled very precisely to create clean enhanced perforated tunnel. With a single trip, several perforation shots can be made withoutthe need to load and unload the perforation tool. Laser source is mounted on the surface on a coiled tubing unit and the beam is transmitted via fiber optics cable totarget, the compact design of the tool make it suitable to fit in any slim hole.}

	abstract		= {The objective of this work is to present the development and evolutions of different high-power laser tools and their subsurface applications. These tools provide innovative and non-damaging alternatives to current downhole conventional technologies. In the lab, the laser technology has been proven to improve the flow properties and communication between the wellbore and formation. To achieve this efficiently in the field it is necessary to develop different tool designs and configurations, manufacture prototypes, conduct extensive tests, and optimize each part before upscale for field operations.  The laser source is mounted in a coil tubing rig at the surface; the coil contains the optical fiber cable used to convey the energy to the downhole tool. The tool combines mechanical and optical components to transform, control, and direct the laser beam. The design and configuration of each tool assembly varies depending on the targeted application. For example, the perforation tool converts and splits the beam into several horizontal beams; whereas the drilling tool emits a straight beam with controlled size for deeper penetration. They also incorporate purging capabilities to circulate gas or fluid to clean the hole from the debris and carry the cuttings. The entire assembly must be made to fit in slim holes as small as four inches. And finally, ruggedized to operate in a complex environment with high pressure and temperature.  The technology improves reach and provides versatility in a compact and environmentally friendly manner. For example, it is a waterless technology when it is used for fracturing, and a non-explosive based perforation when it is used to perforate. The unique features of the technology enable a precise, controlled, and oriented delivery of energy in any direction, regardless of the reservoir stress orientation and magnitude. Thus, it enhances reach to produce from pay zones that are bypassed by current conventional technologies and practice. The motivation to search for alternative technologies is the advancement of technologies including high power lasers, also the need to enhance several applications in deeper wells in an environmentally friendly manner.}

	abstract		= {Downhole drilling dynamics are poorly understood. Neither models nor experiments seem capable of fully describing the movements and forces of the drillstring during drilling. Downhole measurements could potentially hold the key to those missing insights, however data is not yet used to its full potential. This work addresses the barriers to obtaining value from downhole dynamics data and offers solutions to overcome them. A novel kinematic model was developed that fully accounts for sensor position and measurement design. It supports the hypothesis that lateral vibrations cause high-frequency fluctuations of tangential accelerations. Hence, against currently prevailing scientific opinion, \textquotedblleft{}high-frequency torsional oscillations\textquotedblright{} (HFTO) are not actually a torsional phenomenon, but the consequence of a lateral vibration. A downhole measurement tool under off-center rotation captures particular high-frequency data patterns that can be considered a sensor artifact. If ignored, these artifacts can impact the calculations of RPM and other derived measurements from downhole data. An extensive set of downhole data was analyzed to improve downhole dynamics data collection schemes for detecting drilling dysfunctions. For each prominent type of dysfunction, minimum data collection frequencies are specified. Such guidelines assist in collecting downhole data at sampling rates that are high enough to draw meaningful conclusions, but low enough to not flood limited available bandwidth and memory capacities. Even though a sensor is set up to measure only a single parameter along a single axis, it captures a variety of downhole events, which may lead to misinterpretations. These events can still be differentiated based on their typical frequency ranges. It is further shown how `noisy' frequency ranges can be detected and selectively removed by combining multiple downhole measurements. A lack of transparency and inefficient processes around sensor design, data collection, processing, and transfer cause misinterpretation and under-utilization of drilling downhole data. A review of tool design and sensor identifies sources of bad data quality. Eventually, defined data quality requirements will offer sustainable sensor data improvement. To work with downhole data generated under current circumstances, data processing techniques are developed and demonstrated. Algorithms that combine data, drilling processes, and physics automatically correct sensor errors. Further, a machine learning approach for automated vibration classification based on patterns is developed. A standardized structure to transfer downhole data from the service provider to the end user is suggested. The structure does not only define how the data should be shared, but also what additional data (metadata) is required. Specifications of such informational requirements improve transparency and comparability of measurements. Therefore, the proposed data format is a prerequisite for automated drilling data analysis}

	abstract		= {PDC bit modeling has historically incorporated the assumption that cutter forces are constant for a full revolution of the bit. This assumption places considerable limitations on the model's ability to simulate drilling in nonhomogeneous rock and in cases where the bit whirls. Recent studies have shown that cutter damage due to impact loading is a primary cause of PDC bit failure. These impacts may be caused by both bit whirl and drilling through nonhomogeneous rock. The three dimensional model presented in this paper provides the capability to evaluate cutter loading for both of these conditions. It shows that the cutter loads for common drilling situations may be as much as ten times greater than those calculated with previously available two dimensional models.  PDC bit development has been facilitated by models which predict cutter loading, volumes of rock removed, work rates, and cutter wear for a particular bit design. Modeling of the drag style bits was initiated in the 1960's in an effort to better understand the drilling stresses on the hard metal blades which were used as cutting structures. The high stresses were thought to be the cause of the metal fractures, as well as the rapid wear which occurred in the more abrasive formations. The impact stresses on the blades, resulting from dynamic movement of the bit axis away from the hole axis (due to bit wobble), were believed to be a primary cause of the fracturing along the gauge edges of the blades. Two dimensional calculations showed the stresses to be increased by a factor of five for a small misalignment of the bit/hole axes.},

	abstract		= {The ability to analyze drilling data to obtain continuous monitoring statistics of the drilling process and make prompt decisions are two important elements of a successful drilling operation. A mud motor is one of the important components of the downhole assembly, which enables the drill bit to penetrate the rock during drilling a well. Correctly predicting mud motor failure and the remaining useful life of the components are essential for obtaining drilling efficiency, avoiding costly operational expenses, and achieving timely maintenance. The remaining useful life indicator with low uncertainty identifies the life cycle of mud motors by preventing redundant maintenance and costly drilling operation failures.  This paper presents an industry-unique prognostics and health-management (PHM) solution for monitoring and maintaining the mud motor condition. This solution combines three algorithms, including a power section PHM algorithm, lower-end critical connections PHM algorithm, and mud motor degradation algorithm. The workflow solution allows for obtaining valuable information about the mud motor condition at the system and component levels.  The power section PHM algorithm, based on a remaining useful life prediction for the mud motor's power section, provides information about the elastomer condition inside of the stator as a percentage of the remaining life cycle. The lower-end critical connections PHM algorithm estimates the remaining useful life of the mud motor's lower-end connections. Both algorithms are component level; i. e., they help to improve managing the life cycle of the appropriate components. The mud motor degradation algorithm is a system-level algorithm. This algorithm uses drilling data to compute the severity of mud motor degradation; thus, identifying possible problems with the mud motor as a complete system.  The PHM solution helps to prevent expensive mud motor failure. Furthermore, the solution provides the opportunity to perform additional drilling runs before the motor components must be retired or removed for maintenance. The significant advantage of applying the PHM solution is it only makes use of existing drilling measurements and does not require any special downhole equipment.  The mud motor PHM solution is currently in use by one of the biggest oil \& gas service company worldwide. In addition to presenting the three algorithms, this paper presents field application case studies that demonstrate the commercial value and efficiency gains achieved by their use. Significant sustainability benefits have been achieved by using the power section and mud motor degradation algorithms due to their assistance in drilling applications.}

This situation requires new mindset in order to optimize tie-ins of new reserves to existing infrastructure. Retrofit multilateral well solutions are regarded as one enabeler in this context since they enable tie-in to existing producers from nearby targets through deep sidetrack operations.  There are many pre-requisites that must be in place for such solutions to be suitable. In addition, the risk of partial success involves loss of an existing producer.  A few such wells have been constructed by the operator in the last couple of years. The requirements and challenges are discussed.

The designed simulator consists of a topside model capable of calculating block position, surface hookload, surface torque, and bottom hole pressure. To achieve drilling efficiency, a formation-based rate of penetration (ROP) optimization module is running in real-time, where the safe-operational windows are considered to reduce/avoid drilling accidents, like stick-slip, axial vibrations, poor hole cleaning, and low efficiency etc. The obtained optimal WOB and RPM by solving such ROP optimization are used as setpoints and then fed into the rotary steerable system module (RSS module) to steer the bit following a planned path. Such path is designed with multiple Bezier curves that can pass given target coordinates and maintain low dogleg severity (DLS). Furthermore, the high-tech AI methodologies are integrated to the simulator to smartly manage downhole pressure via perceiving and interpreting the data, learning through the trial, training through given policy, and taking optimal actions offered by the AI-agent.  The simulator is demonstrated to be a powerful and user-friendly tool for path design and optimization, real-time path control, and drilling performance optimization. It provides interactive and automatic operations of steering a bit passing multiple given target points and optimizing drilling behaviors to achieve high efficiency and low costs. From the results, the simulated (real-time) trajectory steered by the automatic RSS module integrating with surface drilling/control modules has small deviations from the planned trajectory. In the meanwhile, the simulator can precisely detect formation changes, accurately control the downhole pressure, and automatically optimize the drilling speed.  The progress of the whole simulation can be followed through the web-based graphical user interface (GUI) remotely, where the depth-base data view, time-base data view and 3D graphical wellbore trajectories are visualized. After drilling, data analytics is conducted so that useful information from operational drilling data can be extracted and subsequently evaluated for post well-analysis.}

	abstract		= {This paper describes the methods developed for testing and qualification of novel lightweight drilling fluids (foams, glass-bead fluids) using a unique pilot-scale test facility (PSTF). The performance criteria included fluid stability, rheology, pressure transmission, and gas migration under downhole conditions. Test results demonstrating the methods developed are provided, along with the capabilities of the facility, custom fixtures, and equipment that were built to study the performance of these fluids.  A set of performance criteria and testing requirements were initially developed, which were then used to design and fabricate a novel pilot facility. The PSTF could generate downhole drilling conditions of 7,500 psig and temperatures above 300\textdegree{}F. Three custom-instrumented test articles were built to simulate wellbore geometry; one 10-ft long and one 18-ft long, both with a 2.62-in ID. The third article had a 10-ft long 6-in \texttimes{} 4-in annulus, with the eccentric internal pipe capable of 100-rpm rotation to mimic the drill string. The test articles could incline up to 45\textdegree{} to simulate deviated wells. Gas could be injected, and its migration rate measured in static and countercurrent flow using a video camera with full-bore sight glass, and gamma-ray densitometers. Dedicated sections for foam generation, measuring density, rheology, pressure transmission, and fluid sampling and imaging were provided.  Upon commissioning of the PSTF, a 1 1/2 year test program was successfully carried out using lightweight foams and hollow glass-bead fluids. Due to the novel nature of the tests, best practices and procedures were developed through experimentation to quantify static and dynamic fluid stability, gas migration, foam generation techniques, fluid imaging and characterization, pressure transmission, and rheology. A variety of measurement techniques and instrumentation were trialed in the test articles to determine the best methods for tracking gas migration. Experiments in the test articles yielded a large amount of performance data, including fluid stability over time at different temperature and pressure conditions, the impact of drill string rotation on fluid stability, migration velocities of gas bubbles (i.e., gas kicks) within the drilling fluids at stagnant and countercurrent flow conditions, and the impact of drill string rotation. Pressure transmission speeds were measured in the foam with varying gas fractions. Example datasets from the testing program are provided, along with detailed descriptions of the test methods.  The methods and test facility used to study lightweight drilling fluids are unique to the authorsâ€™ knowledge. For the first time, drilling fluids were analyzed in an annulus with a rotating pipe at downhole conditions at a pilot scale, and fluid stability along with gas migration were studied. These provide for rigorous testing of lightweight drilling fluids; the application of these fluids is expected to increase with declining reservoir pressures in oil and gas fields.}

Despite constant improvement in tools, products, and processes, data science has not played a large part in oil well drilling. With the implementation of data science in the energy sector, companies have come to see significant value in efficiently processing the massive amounts of data produced by the multitude of internet of thing (IOT) sensors at the rig. The scope of this project is to combine academia and industry experience to analyze data from 13 different wells drilled in an area of 2 x 4 miles. The data was collected in the same rig and contains over 12 million electronic drilling recorder data points, drillerâ€™s activity logs and well profiles. The main focus is to propose a detailed workflow to clean and process real drilling data. Once cleaned, the data can be fed into data analytics platforms and machine learning models to efficiently analyze trends and plan future well more efficiently. This roadmap will serve as a basis for drilling optimization. The objective of this work is to detail the various steps needed to prepare field drilling data for business analysis, as well discuss about data analytics and machine learning application in drilling operations.

	abstract		= {Case studies have shown the benefits of applying a unique wellbore stabilization technology to solve lost circulation events occurring in varying pressurize, permeable, and fragile formations. Leveraging this technology can increase successful drilling in geologically complex areas while avoiding conventional solutions that are both costly and and, in some cases, do not solve the causes of non-productive time.  A unique wellbore stabilization technology has been proven effective in offshore wells in areas that are known to present small vugs, natural fissures, formation failure, wellbore erosion, and the associated drilling problems of lost circulation, poor cementing quality, problems running pipe, etc. When compared with the cost and operational lack of success offered by conventional ``solutions'' versus the relative low-cost and operational successes of the unique wellbore stabilization technology, the choice is clear \textendash{} where use is appropriate, the stabilization technology has provided a greater success rate and trouble-free drilling operations at a lower cost than traditional solutions.  The unique wellbore stabilization product is designed to address microfractures (as small as 3 $\mu$m) up to much larger fractures (3,000 $\mu$m). The product can be added to oil-based or water-based fluids at functional levels without adversely impacting the fluid rheology. Once in the drilling fluid, the stabilization product forms a pressure-sensitive layer on the formation wall to isolate the drilling fluid from the wellbore and stop fluid invasion that leads to formation failure, uncontrollable lost circulation, and well control issues. Once drilling is completed, the drop in pressure differential of the wellbore fluid allows the protective particles in the drilling fluid to lift off with the initiation of production. In the Campeche wells, one early study showed a 36\% reduction in drilling time and 24\% reduction in cost.  This paper discusses the various options explored and detail the technical analysis that preceded the application of the wellbore stability technology. Case studies are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the fluid technology in drilling three wells which encountered variable pressure regimes, from the highly pressurized Paleocene at around 5,000 m to underlying low-pressure sandstones. These three wells and their offsets represent the successful application of this low-invasion technology in major drilling basins where lost circulation events would normally incur major operational expenses and non-productive time (NPT).}

	abstract		= {The extraction of mechanical friction, during drilling operations, is an important source of information to estimate whether the downhole conditions are sub-optimal, for instance because of poor cuttings transport or additional tortuosity induced by the directional work. Traditionally, the friction factors are extracted using steady state torque and drag models. But, there are contexts, like when drilling from a floater, where it is difficult to find any periods where stable conditions can be observed.  A possible solution to this problem consists in running, in real-time, a transient torque and drag model connected to a high refresh-rate feed of measurements taken by the drilling machines sensors, and to utilize continuous calibration methods to extract information about the unknown or ill-defined parameters that influence the drill-string mechanical system. For those parameters that should stay constant throughout a bottom hole assembly (BHA) run, the estimation method shall account for the totality of the observations and therefore utilizes calibration methods based on statistical global optimization principles, while time-dependent parameters are estimated using a filtering technique.  This approach is only valid when utilizing a trustworthy transient drill-string mechanical model. Comparisons between estimated values from transient torque and drag models and actual measurements have highlighted the importance of robust modelling at the boundaries of the mechanical system. For instance, when modelling precisely the top-drive and the hoisting system mechanical behavior with its associated heave compensation system, it is then possible to obtain a good match between estimated and observed top-drive torques and top-of-string forces, while the bit is off bottom. Furthermore, it requires a precise modelling of the bit/formation interaction to get a truthful dynamic response of the model when the bit is on bottom and only passive heave compensation is used. Associated with its continuously updated calibration of the ill-defined parameters of the system, such a transient torque and drag model enables the visualization, in real-time, of the internal displacements of the drill-string even in the most complex drilling conditions.  Until recently, drill-string dynamic modelling has mostly focused on the lower part of the drill-string, i.e. just above the BHA, and has been reserved to post-analysis evaluations, as existing solutions have been very computer intensive. This paper describes a solution that runs in real-time and that considers the whole drill-string, allowing for the extension of drilling automation functions to very dynamic conditions like those encountered on a floater.}

	abstract		= {The use of downhole rotational speed measurements made at 300Hz gives new insight into the conditions under which stick-slip torsional oscillations occur. Observations made with high-frequency magnetometers while drilling two reservoir sections have shown, that for these wellbores, using top-drive speeds below 140rpm leads to severe downhole torsional oscillations, also in off-bottom conditions. Additionally, it was observed that downlinking the rotary steerable system (RSS) initiated heavy stick-slip and that reaming downward had a negative damping effect on downhole torsional stability.  These observations have been compared and partly matched with estimations made with a transient hydro-mechanical model. Some ill-defined information had to be estimated, like the amount of flow diversion during the downlinking procedure, the coefficients of static and kinetic friction along the borehole, or the bit efficiency and aggressivity.  Downhole measurements have shown that when the drill-string is subject to strong stick-slip conditions, the downhole rotational speed changes from stationary to more than 400rpm in just a fraction of a second. It is therefore important to utilize sampling rates that are compatible with such very fast events. In practice, that means several hundred Hertz.  A challenge associated with analysis of downhole high frequency data is time synchronization and drift of clocks between the surface and downhole measurements. After time synchronization and correction, it appears that the downhole rotational movement is delayed by several tens of seconds compared to the actual top-drive speed. This leads to question whether rotating the drill-string off-bottom, typically done in order to break gelled-up mud prior to establishing circulation, has any significant the intended effects deviated wells as torque along the drill-string must be built up.  Direct observations of downhole rotational speed at high frequency help in discovering conditions that were not suspected to lead to large torsional oscillations. This new information can be used to improve drilling operational procedures and models of the drilling process, therefore enabling increased drilling efficiency.}

	abstract		= {Drilling process automation solutions provide positive assistance to the driller, and increase consistency in execution of drilling procedures. However, in drilling automation the use of automated drilling advisors can reduce human operator situational awareness. Therefore, systems that automatically detect and react to drilling incidents must support the driller. These critical systems cover Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) functions. This paper presents a method that facilitates the interoperability of drilling automation advisors for FDIR functions. Some drilling events happen so fast that mitigation (FDIR) must be implemented directly at the automated drilling control system (ADCS) level. Yet, FDIR functions often need dynamic parametrization from external sources since the ADCS may lack access to mandatory information needed for correct detection and mitigation of the incident. This requires interoperability, communications without human intervention, between the ADCS and the external sources of the parameters for the FDIR function. To interconnect the two sides of the problem, the ADCS describes its capabilities for fault detection and isolation and the external application, the automation Advisor, adapts to the exposed capabilities. On the one hand, the ADCS may implement various types of FDIR functions. On the other hand, external dynamic parameter functions may only address certain types of drilling incidents. Different ADCS providers implement such FDIR functionalities in different ways. Since this undermines the portability (interoperability) of the solutions provided by third party advisor applications, any drilling systems automation solution must address this communication issue. The simplest form of communication describes predefined capabilities, providing the ability to communicate based on an agreement about a set of statically defined possibilities. At an intermediate level of complexity, the ADCS describes its capabilities in a descriptive format that the external application interprets, and to which it can adapt. In the most advanced version, the ADCS describes that it allows the external parameter provider to configure the ADCS behavior to its needs. The paper describes a generic data model covering all three levels of the interface. Another implementation of the model is in the form of a micro-service that implements a REST API and exchanges Json formatted data objects. The latter is therefore agnostic to programming languages and computer platforms. This work is part of the D-WIS (Drilling and Wells Interoperability Standard) initiative advancing industry wells digital systems interoperability. D-WIS is a cross-industry workgroup providing the industry with solutions to facilitate interoperability of digital and computer systems at the rig site. The proposed solution delivers retrofitting ease for existing solutions but is sufficiently flexible to accommodate to new and not yet known FDIR functions. It is a key function for systems interoperability at the rig site, directly addressing situational awareness for the driller.}

	abstract		= {In difficult drilling environments, a critical aspect for success is BHA design optimization in the pre-job phase. In previous operations, modeling and run simulations have proven valuable at helping operators improve drilling efficiency (reduce NPT; increase footage/day), produce high-quality log data and properly position the wellbore to increase contact with the reservoir. To further improve modeling accuracy/reliability, a dynamic modeling system was used for BHA analysis. The FEA (finite element analysis)-based system enables engineers to leverage the team's combined expertise and full suite of drilling tools to optimize a BHA for a specific application.  Four criteria are used to evaluate BHA performance during simulations: stability; robustness/reliability; measurement quality; steerability. Simulations are run to determine each configuration's potential for axial, lateral/torsional vibration and identify the root cause and dominant mode. To ensure maximum BHA robustness, the loading on BHA components is mapped/rated allowing refinements to increase BHA service life and reduce the potential for costly NPT. Simulations are run to observe the potential for MWD/LWD tool deformation and sag angle to determine the adverse effect sensor motion could have on measurement quality. To mitigate steerability issues, build/walk tendencies are simulated to determine how the BHA will respond to steering command from RSS/PDM.  A wide-range of factors can be considered in this procedure. Various cutting structures and steering tools are analyzed and modified as required. The type and location of BHA components are also modeled and re-positioned for optimization purposes. Various drilling scenarios and operating parameters are fed into the system including RPM/WOB, sliding/rotating time, back-reaming and rotating off bottom. Formation characteristics including rock types, friction factor, heterogeneity/homogeneity, degree/amount of interbedding can all be varied to investigate the BHA's corresponding directional implications and vibrational response.  All potential BHA designs are evaluated under a set of pre-defined drilling scenarios. A comparative analysis is performed to investigate BHA responses against each specific criterion to identify the optimum BHA configuration. Operating conditions are analyzed for each BHA and an optimal parameter window of minimized BHA shock and vibration is generated with a range of RPM/WOB recommendations. The authors will present several conclusive case studies that document the method's effectiveness and cost reducing capabilities.}

	abstract		= {Deepwater wells routinely use concentric reaming devices in the bottomhole assembly (BHA) to lower the equivalent circulating density (ECD). In Gulf of Mexico (GOM) applications, concentric reamers are frequently used and are positioned approximately 100 to 150 feet behind the pilot bit to address formation evaluation and other operational constraints. This distance between a drill bit and the concentric reamer poses bit\textendash{}reamer synchronization challenges, especially while drilling interbedded formations, where the bit could drill a softer formation while the reamer is placed in a harder formation or vice versa. This situation causes fluctuations in the compressive load at the bit and reamer. Cutting element damage often results from overloading, leading to a premature and costly trip. In many cases, the pilot bit or reamer could be deprived of the optimal compressive load to cut the formation, resulting in lower-than-expected penetration rates. Inadequate and fluctuating compressive loads at the bit or reamer often trigger unsustainable vibrations.  Efforts to address the bit-reamer matching issue are ongoing in the industry, and managing the aggressiveness of pilot bit and reamer is frequently used as a potential solution. Although modelling programs are extensively used during the well planning process, a lack of specific guidelines continues to exist in the industry.  Hybrid bits, which combine polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) and tungsten carbide insert (TCI) rolling cutter elements, have been widely and successfully used in GOM. These bits offer higher drilling efficiency because of their dual cutting elements and balanced aggressiveness. The results of 18?-in. hybrid drill bit usage with a concentric reamer provided encouraging results and offered a potential solution to the bit-reamer synchronization issue.  Using real-time downhole data, this paper evaluates and compares bit and reamer load distribution, drilling mechanics of PDC and hybrid bits, and provides valuable analytical insights on successful application of hybrid bits to address the issue of bit-reamer synchronization.}

	abstract		= {The current IADC bit dull grading process has served the drilling industry well for over 30 years, and it has helped the industry achieve significant improvements in drill bit selection and design. With rapid development of computational techniques such as computer vision and machine learning, the general consensus is that the previous grading process can now be updated to capture additional information about the bits that was previously discarded to enhance the grading process and the information is delivers while keeping it simple. An IADC committee is currently working on finalizing this new schema.  In comparison to the previous bit dull grading process, more details about the drill bit such as cutter damage type have been added to the new schema. Additionally, capturing pre-run and post-run bit images is recommended to enable detailed bit forensic analysis into root causes of observed damage. For the bit dull grading process at rig site, a preliminary grading report needs to be filled out and rig site bit photos also need to be captured.  The objective of the work reported here was to develop an algorithm to automatically analyze 2D bit images and quickly generate are port that fulfills the new IADC dull grading requirements. Several deep learning models and classic machine learning algorithms were developed to automate the bit dull grading process. Given a set of high-quality bit images, the proposed set of algorithms will process and analyze the images automatically and generate a dull grading report. Different sets of bit images were tested with the proposed algorithms, and the results show that they are able to achieve good performance under standard scenarios. A discussion on hurdles that remain to be tackled is also included.}

	abstract		= {This paper is concerned with an investigation of the drilling response of drag bits (or PDC bits, as they are often referred to), i.e. with the study of the relations between weighht-on-bit W, torque T, angular velocity ? and rate of penetration v. Following an early suggestion (Fairhurst and Lacabanne, Min. Quarry Engng, 157-161, 194-197, 1957) that the bit-rock interaction is characterized by the coexistence of rock cutting and frictional contact, the torque and weight-on-bit are each decomposed into two components associated with these basic processes. By postulating that the cutting component of T and W is proportional to the depth of cut per revolution, ? = 2?v/?, and that a linear constraint exists between the frictional component of T and W, a linear relation is derived between the specific energy E and the drilling strength L two quantities with dimensions of stress, that are respectively proportional to T and W, and inversely proportional to ?. The original assumptions appear to be justified when the model is tested against published experimental results, as the data point cluster along a line in the E-L diagram. Interpretation of experimental data suggests that the contact friction coefficient actually reflects the internal frictional property of the rock. It is also proposed that the influence of the bit design on the drilling response is embodied in a single number ?, which depends on the shape of the cutting edge and on the distribution of cutters on the bit body.}

The directional wells and other special trajectory drilling technologies are often used in deep water, deep well, hard rock, and brittle shale formations.  In drilling these complex wells, the cost caused by V\&S increases. According to past theories, indoor experiments, and field studies, the relations among ten kinds of V\&S, which contain basic forms, response frequency, and amplitude, are summarized and discussed. Two evaluation methods are compared systematically, such as theoretical and measurement methods. Typical vibration measurement tools are investigated and discussed. The control technologies for drill string V\&S are divided into passive control, active control, and semiactive control. Key methods for and critical equipment of three control types are compared. Based on the past development, a controlling program of drill string V\&S is devised. Application technologies of the drill string V\&S are discussed, such as improving the rate of penetration, controlling borehole trajectory, finding source of seismic while drilling, and reducing the friction of drill string. Related discussions and recommendations for evaluating, controlling, and applying the drill string V\&S are made.},

	abstract		= {This paper recommends standardized names and equations for the two most common uses of Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) concepts: ``Total MSE'' and "Downhole MSE". These names and their equations should be used uniformly in all applications, including electronic drilling recorder (EDR) pick lists, rig site surveillance, engineering surveillance, data analytics, research, and technical publications.  Mechanical Specific Energy, used as a metric for drilling efficiency, is a mathematical calculation of the energy used per volume of rock drilled. The Downhole MSE equation calculates the efficiency of the bit alone, while the Total MSE equation includes both the bit and drill string. Those who use MSE in surveillance or analytics know the negative effects created by the lack of standardization over the years; it is certainly not a new problem.  The lack of standardized nomenclature has resulted in the use of the same name for different equations, or different names are given two equations that are identical. This affects the ability of drill teams to engage vendors in redesign of performance limitations or to communicate new operational practices between teams or rigs. In addition, this standard corrects a mathematical error that is common in calculating the Total MSE.  The concern with the inconsistencies has increased as MSE has become a key element in many automated optimization schemes. Inconsistencies or uncertainties in the basis of MSE values calculated in real time or shared in large data sets will affect the industry's ability to develop useful analytics or to automate rig control platforms and data-driven decisions.  This paper also includes a discussion of the MSE measurement errors and their effect on calculated values, which is of particular interest to controls engineers and those involved in data analytics. Examples are provided to illustrate how the two different MSE values are used in field operations. Also, a substantial reference list of current and potential future uses of MSE is included to encourage better MSE-based practices to potentially lead to the development of new uses in the future, including automation.  This ad hoc MSE Standardization Committee is a volunteer group with representation from operators, rig contractors, service companies, and data acquisition vendors.  The guidance given reflects there shared experience in utilizing MSE in surveillance and analytics, and the recommended equations are technically correct.},

	abstract		= {The drillstring used in the oil and gas exploration is a complex structure due to the different forces acting on it. One of the
primary sources of drillstring vibrations is the cutting forces caused by the drill bit contact with the rock formation. In some drilling applications, such as hole enlargement and underreaming, the source of the cutting action originates from the drill bit as well as the reamer which increases the dynamic complexity of the drillstring. This paperâ€™s objective is to investigate the torsional vibration behaviors of the bottom hole assembly (BHA) under simultaneous drilling and reaming. More specifically, it addresses the effect of the reamer interaction with the wellbore during drilling operations on the overall torsional
vibrations of the BHA. The BHA was modeled as a torsional shaft subjected to a localized external force due to the reamer cutting action, and a point load external force due to the drill bit interaction with the formation. The equation of motion was obtained using Hamiltonâ€™s principle, and modal expansion was used to solve the equation of motion. The results showed that the location of the reamer within the BHA plays an important role in vibrations response. It was found that vibration modes that exhibit symmetry within the reamer location show a negligible effect on the overall BHA torsional response. Reamers with aggressive cutters cause higher vibration response when compared with a drill bit with the same cutter aggressiveness. The simplified model reveals the significance of properly matching the drill bit and the reamer to reduce the overall BHA torsional vibrations.}

	abstract		= {Drilling dynamics models play an important role in drilling performance optimization. These models can be classified as engineering tools or research tools, depending on functionality. Engineering tools are designed for everyday use; they provide estimates of important parameters for planning purposes, such as natural frequencies and buckling loads. Research tools describe the physics of the problem more completely, and thus are more powerful. They allow complex phenomena to be studied in great detail, but require a greater investment of time and effort. Both types of models require validation, either through laboratory testing or controlled field tests. Once confidence in the models is established they can be used in a number of ways, including component design, bottom hole assembly (BHA) design, and investigation of component contributions to overall drilling system performance.Application of advanced dynamics models within one major service company has provided some valuable lessons. Examples include: (1) polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit designs can be adjusted to minimize impact damage to cutters; (2) roller cone designs can be adjusted to reduce off-center running tendencies; (3) BHA stabilization can be optimized to protect sensitive downhole equipment; (4) BHA designs that are unstable can cause rapid bit destruction; (5) operating parameters can be adjusted to improve performance of sub-optimal drilling systems.Case studies from disparate drilling applications around the world have demonstrated that performance can be improved by applying lessons learned from advanced dynamics models. Operators have experienced significant savings in rig time stemming from reduced tool failure frequency and increased drilling efficiency. Greater tool longevity and reduced maintenance costs have also benefited the service company.}

	abstract		= {Characteristics of formations usually cause changes in the drilling parameters such as weight on bit and drill string rotational speed as well as drill string dynamic behavior. When the drill bit breaks up formations, some of the energy dedicated to drilling is transmitted to the drill string as axial, lateral and torsional vibrations. Although these vibrations are affected by the drilling parameters, it has been experienced that vibration measurements can be used to evaluate formations during drilling a well. For this purpose a laboratory scale drilling rig was used to perform numerous experiments. During the drilling operations, several drilling parameters as well as vibrations with three-component accelerometers attached to the drill string were recorded continuously. Numerous uniform concrete and rock samples were drilled by a double roller cone bit. The uniaxial compressive strength of all concretes and rocks were measured prior to the experiments.  The tests were executed using different combinations of weight on bit and rotary speed.  For a subsequent evaluation statistical features were extracted in a first step from the recorded data in both, the time domain and the frequency domain. Those features formed the base for the formation classification by linear and non-linear models. Although linear models like Bayesian inference are not suited for that challenge, it turned out that non-linear models like neural networks provide excellent results in both, the training and the test data-set. Finally, the application of parameter selection methods showed that mechanical specific energy and rate of penetration in combination with higher order frequency moments of all recorded vibration types play the major role in the formation classification.},

	abstract		= {Vibration from High Frequency Torsional Oscillation (HFTO) damages drilling tools and electronics.  Destructive HFTO can occur in harsh drilling environments which reduces drilling performance and reliability and leads to non-productive time and associated costs.  Because it is faster, cheaper, more precise, and more controllable compared to field testing, a laboratory test environment is optimal for developing HFTO countermeasures. However, until now, a full-scale test rig that reliably generates controllable HFTO did not exist. This paper will describe for the first time a laboratory drilling rig that generates HFTO and, therefore, can be used to develop and qualify anti-HFTO procedures and tools.  To study the HFTO susceptibility of bit-rock interactions, the full-scale laboratory drilling rig consists of a mud circulation system, hoisting system, bit, and BHA coupled with high-frequency instrumentation to measure torsional vibrations on a millisecond scale. Finite element models (FEM) built to characterize the drilling simulator are used to correctly interpret the results of drilling data. An experimental modal analysis (EMA) is used to validate and refine the FEM models. Next, PDC-bits are used to drill several rocks under varying pressures, RPMs, and weights on bit (WOB). The resulting high-frequency torque and tangential acceleration data are compared to a checklist of necessary criteria to prove that self-excited HFTO occur in the lab. These measurements, when considered with their axial sensor positions, are used to reliably identify HFTO and compare bit-rock combinations by their susceptibility to HFTO.  Results of the FEM-models and the EMA agree on the characteristic mode shapes and dominant frequencies which match dynamic measurements. Recorded data show that self-excited HFTO are reliably excited when the criteria for self-excitation are fulfilled. Vibration energy is concentrated in one dominant mode, the vibration amplitude is scaled by the RPM, and the frequency of torsional oscillations is independent of the rig RPM. HFTO-prone rocks are identified using segmented rock specimen tests. The excitation mechanism in the laboratory test rig corresponds to the mechanism in the field. Stability maps show that bits differ in excitability allowing a comparison based on bit features and subsequent bit improvements. Methods and tools tested in the lab environment form a framework for developing anti-HFTO field solutions and operational guidelines.  The upgraded full-scale drilling rig reliably generates HFTO in a laboratory environment under realistic drilling conditions. When coupled with extended research into the combination of bit, rock and BHA variables that lead to HFTO susceptibility, this rig will enable faster and cost-efficient product and procedure development cycles for proven and validated anti-HFTO tools and field guidelines. An HFTO suppressing bit or an HFTO suppressing damping device will have a significant impact on BHA reliability, drilling performance, and reduced NPT.}

This article presents the concept of a supervisory/ advisory systems dedicated to support the detection of abnormal events and to provide guidelines for fluid treatment actions.  The proposed methodology consisted of two stages: experimental data acquisition in a flow loop and data processing for the validation of the algorithm. In the data acquisition stage, multiple properties of the drilling fluids were continuously measured by using automatic sensors. In the second stage, the drilling fluid's properties were processed in a fault detection algorithm. The algorithm used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to train the process model through the calculation of the principal components of the steady state of the fluid, which represents the healthy state of the drilling fluid.  Once the process was trained, the algorithm monitored new data samples obtained in the data acquisition stage and compared them to the trained model by calculation of the mean square prediction error (MSPE) of the model and the T{$^2$} of Hoteling. Persistent changes in MSPE and T{$^2$} values indicated that an anomaly was occurring in the drilling fluid. The new methodology was validated based on the data obtained in a flow loop where fluid properties were monitored using online sensor under different operational conditions. The algorithm was able to detect faults and anomalies in the drilling fluid even identifying the source of the anomalies through the decomposition of the MSPE and T{$^2$} statistics. The proposed algorithm performed well in real-time conditions, pointing out that it can be used as a diagnostic tool in-field oil well drilling operations.}

	abstract		= {This paper describes the development of a novel wellhead load relief system improving operational aspects and wellhead fatigue management achieved by an unconventional utilization of existing equipment. The objective is to provide insight in a newly developed technology for Wellhead Fatigue mitigation with the potential to become a future element in fatigue management. The operational aspect is appealing as this system is effective with remotely operated hook-up and a minimum of additional equipment needed. The development of the system started in 2015 during planning of several exploration wells and have continued as a cooperation between the drilling and subsea disciplines within Equinor.  The Guidepost Well Load Relief (GP-WLR) seeks to be a load reduction and operational effective wellhead load relief system through integration of WLR functionality with existing BOPs and redirecting well load thru guideposts and subsea structures already present. The GP WLR system is modular which provides for flexibility in finding a way of adding it to legacy equipment. The basic idea of such a system is explained and then how the development has evolved internally in Equinor from idea, concept, prototype, and implementation. At this stage the GP-WLR technology has been used in operations by a subsea drilling Blow Out Preventer (BOP) and a Work Over stack. The effect and use of the system will be discussed in an operational perspective. The operation of the GP-WLR system is using remote access. Experiences gained during prototype testing and first-time use have shown that the GP-WLR system have worked as intended.  The authors believe GP-WLR to be a significant contribution to the wellhead fatigue mitigation toolbox while reducing the risk for damage to equipment and personnel.  GP-WLR will be a significant contribution to the wellhead fatigue management and allows optimizing drilling schedule while also reducing the risk for damage to equipment and personnel.}

	abstract		= {Managed pressure drilling (MPD) and managed pressure cementing (MPC) typically use lighter fluids than in conventional drilling. One consequence of this is that the fluid behind the casing being run and cemented is lighter than would be the case with conventional drilling. This has implications to the casing design for two reasons: the burst loads on the casing are augmented due to the lower external density profile, and the annular pressure buildup (APB) loads are different. It is important to consider these design implications while performing the casing design, particularly for deepwater wells. Unfortunately, this is not common at present, since the MPD/MPC design work and the casing design work are often distinct and separate, both physically and temporally. When the lower density external fluid from MPD/MPC is considered in the casing design, it is possible that the casing in question has to be upgraded (increased weight and grade) to accommodate the loads post MPD/MPC. This paper presents such a case, where the consequence of having drilled the section using MPD and cementing the casing using MPC was to upgrade the casing. The paper further presents a solution to this problem- modifying the MPC procedures such that a heavier mud than that used during MPD can be placed above the top of the cement behind the casing, thus mitigating the loads and eliminating the need for a heavier or higher-grade casing. The authors show how this can be achieved, by managing the densities of the different fluids and cement during the MPC operation. The authors hope that this work highlights the interconnectedness of well design and MPD/MPC operations, and engenders more interaction between the two groups during well engineering.}

	abstract		= {{PDC} drill bit performances in hard rock has been greatly improved during the last decades by innovations in PDC wear, impact resistance and better vibrations understanding. The bit design is generally done by balancing the bit, distributing uniform wear along the profile and achieving high drillability and steerability. To obtain required drilling performances, drill bit designer adjust features such as profile shape, gage and mainly cutter characteristics (shape, type and orientation). Cutter rock interaction model became a critical feature in the design process. But previously used models considered only three forces on a cutter based on the cutter-rock contact area: drag force, normal force and side force. Such models are no longer valid with the introduction of PDC cutters with chamfer and special shape.  This paper presents a new cutter rock interaction model including some several improvements. It is based on the presence of a build-up edge of crushed materials on the cutting face often described in the literature. In addition, the chamfer, which significantly affects bit Rate Of Penetration (ROP), is taken into account (shape and size). Forces applied on the back of the cutter and due to the rock deformation and back flow of crushed materials are considered in the model. Finally, results of numerous single cutter tests (under atmospheric and confining pressure) are presented and compared to the new cutter rock interaction model predictions. An analysis of the influence of the PDC characteristics (shape, size, chamfer, back and side rake angles, \ldots{}.) is presented.  The model has been applied to optimize the cutting efficiency and bit steerability and some design rules are given to minimize the specific energy and maximize the rate of penetration. Finally, full scale laboratory drilling tests and field results indicate that the use of accurate cutter rock interaction model can help the drill bit designer to find the best drill bit for a specific application. Standard laboratory full scale drilling procedures have been developed. The tests have shown that drillability, stability, steerability and wear can be improved and controlled by acting on the cutter characteristics, cutter setup, trimmer characteristics and gage type.}

The method uses single-cutter data to provide a measure of rock drillability and employs theoretical considerations to account for interaction among closely spaced cutters on the bit. Experimental data are presented to establish the effects of cutter size and wearflat area on the forces that develop during rock cutting. Waterjet assistance is shown to significantly reduce cutting forces, thereby potentially extending bit life and reducing weight-on-bit and torque requirements in hard rock. The effects of several other design and operating parameters on bit life and drilling performance are also investigated.}

In addition to maintaining wellbore stability, its rheological properties also play a crucial role in enhancing overall drilling performance. An accurate description of the rheological behavior of drilling fluids is essential in optimizing drilling fluid hydraulics. This study evaluates traditional and novel optimization algorithms for the parameterization of rheological models using an extensive field rheological database of KCl/Polymer drilling fluids. An objective function based on a symmetric mean absolute percent error is used in parameterizing rheological models. Golden Section Search (GSS), Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG), and Trust Region (TR) methods are used as new alternatives to traditional Gaussian-Newton (GN) and linear/semi-linear regression (LR/QLR) methods. As a more statistically plausible criterion, the symmetric mean absolute percentage error is also used to measure the goodness of fit of rheological models with datasets. It has been shown that GRG and TR algorithms outperform conventional methods in finding optimal model parameters. The three- and four-parameter models fitted the rheological data best, with a more uniform symmetrical error distribution than the two-parameter models.}

	abstract		= {Longer wells and increasing complexity of the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) are causing drilling operations to become harder to achieve. Combined with strict timelines and the demand for higher rates of penetration (ROP), the entire drilling system operates at its physical (loads, bending moment, etc.) and operational (drilled formation, drilling parameters, well path, etc\ldots{}) limits. Exceeding these limits can induce excessive drilling vibrations and dysfunctions like whirl that can be harmful for bit, bottomhole assembly, reaming device or drillpipe. Neglecting operational limits can therefore lead to damage, wear and tool failures that ultimately result in nonproductive time (NPT) and higher cost.  Additionally, the number of reaming operations increases. The added challenge of complex reaming operations demands supplementary planning effort. In this paper, the authors focus on prejob and post-well analysis using simulation and modeling techniques. The result of the analysis leads to optimized reaming and drilling practices that are further elaborated following close interaction with field personnel. Applying the improved drilling practices result in best-in-class performance and lower nonproductive time.  In-house dynamics simulation software is used to calculate the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes of the BHA. Differences in BHA setup are associated, critical excitation sources identified and forced response analysis results compared.  Data from various deployments of a high-end rotary steerable system (RSS) BHA with a reaming device are analyzed and used to validate the simulation results. The data is derived exclusively from a massive salt section (similar formation being drilled) to lessen the formationâ€™s influence on drillstring dynamics.  Incorporation of sophisticated simulation tools plus the close cooperation of field personnel resulted in excellent operational and drilling performance. In todayâ€™s challenging drilling applications, the insights gained have highlighted further opportunities for delivering optimal performance, and further assuring bit, BHA, reaming device and drillstring integrity.}

	abstract		= {Drilling hard stringers that are erratically distributed in an underlying rather soft formation is challenging from different perspectives. An unforeseen change of the drilled formation from soft to hard and dense rock can cause impact damage to the bit, deflect the bottom-hole assembly (BHA), result in high bending loads, increase vibration, and cause wear/tear on BHA components. If not properly managed, this leads to non-productive time (NPT) and increased maintenance costs. Further, a deflection caused by a stringer away from the planned well path that is detected late results in high local doglegs (HLD) and requires time-consuming correction through reaming with invisible lost time (ILT).  Recently, a stringer detection method based on vibrations, namely high-frequency torsional oscillations(HFTO), has been presented. A case study with 21 sections in the North Sea based on this solution is shown that demonstrates a reduction in ILT by 80\%.  The system is based on a timely and reliable detection of stringers, an optimized mud pulse telemetry scheme, and an automated advisory system. The downhole algorithm embedded in a measurement while drilling tool is consistently interpreting HFTO based on tangential acceleration and dynamic torsional torque measurement. By defining thresholds for the amplitude and the localization with respect to frequency content of HFTO, the algorithm results are translated into a binary value with 1 \textendash{} stringer currently drilled or 0 - no stringer is drilled. The low bandwidth consuming 1-bit value and downhole measured bending moment are sent in 10 to 15 second intervals to the surface by mud pulse telemetry. Once the stringer is detected, the bending moment data is closely monitored to react correctly and efficiently to a stringer indifferent scenarios.  This solution is discussed in a case study in Norway covering 21 sections with and without the system deployed. The offshore application is challenged by frequently occurring stringer layers and nodules of different geometry. Based on the stringer content, the reaming time has been typically high in this application. The system, however, enabled a timely detection of the stringers and an optimal stringer drilling enabled by the frequently sent bending moment information. Therefore, stringer drilling was done without having to pull off-bottom frequently and ream the transition area between soft and hard formation thereby saving time and reducing wear on the BHA and drill pipe, ultimately ending up with a smoother/straighterwellbore.  By using the system, a faster reaction to any stringer and the use of appropriate parameters to avoid costly HLDs are achieved. The case study demonstrates a significant and consistent improvement in ILT.  The reaming hours per 1000 m as a benchmark have been reduced from 2-5 hours without to 0.3-0.6 hours with the system resulting in an average saving of 12 hours per reservoir section.}

	abstract		= {Achieving optimal performance during drilling of complex well trajectories is often hindered by downhole drill-string vibrations and stick-slip. These can lead to drill bit and downhole tool damage, drill-string wear possibly leading to a twist-off, or formation damage. Recent advancements in drill-string vibration interpretation show that the sources of excitation are not only at the bit but anywhere along the string. Therefore, a solution that uses distributed along-string damping elements based on magnetic damping is investigated. This paper presents the design principles of a laboratory-scale setup to verify the concept and the accompanying test results.  Previously published numerical results show that stick-slip can be attenuated using the distributed damping elements. The elements attempt to reduce drill-string vibration by attenuating the sources of negative damping, and by increasing the sources of positive damping. Mechanical friction between the drill-string and the borehole, a major source of axial and torsional vibrations, is reduced, and its axial and tangential components are decoupled. Magnetic viscous damping is introduced by utilizing eddy current braking at the level of each element.  A laboratory-scale setup consisting of a 10-meter-long horizontal apparatus has been constructed to verify the damping effectiveness of an individual element. The setup was designed to mimic downhole drilling conditions such as drill-string elasticity, friction forces and inertial moments, and to recreate real-world adverse conditions such as vibrations, stick-slip, and twist-off. Sensors and actuators positioned along the experimental setup allow control of the rotational and axial velocities, contact forces at various locations, and adjustment of the magnetic braking force. Stick-slip was introduced in the system through an adjustable side force imposed on the drill-string as well as through a stepper motor operating in torque mode simulating the bit-rock interaction.  The first series of experiments in the laboratory-scale setup were aimed at evaluating the braking force obtained in different operating conditions. By controlling the strength of the eddy current effect, the magnitude of the braking force could be varied, and thus, the damping effectiveness of the element could be estimated. The braking force, measured by a load cell, was found to increase linearly with the rotational speed and with the strength of the magnetic field. The second round of experiments were focused on demonstrating how the magnetic braking effect helps damping out torsional vibrations and mitigating stick-slip.  A novel concept for damping stick-slip vibrations using magnetic damping elements distributed along the drill-string has been implemented and demonstrated at laboratory-scale. This concept aims to mitigate stick-slip vibration by addressing its root cause, the friction forces along the drill-string. The experimental setup can also be used to prototype and test new control strategies for damping of drill-string vibrations.}

	abstract		= {With continually increasing drilling costs, the importance of utilizing existing slots in offshore platforms has never been higher in increasing average rate of recovery from the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Utilizing existing slots for new targets that were once inaccessible due to a multitude of reasons including technology limitations, value justification, among others pose many challenges for the operator.  One of these challenges specifically relates to compliance with current well design criteria and barrier requirements. As our industry has evolved, more stringent design criteria and additional well barrier requirements ensuring well integrity have become commonplace. In addition, integrity reduction of previously installed downhole components must be accounted for. Utilizing casing strings and polished bore receptacles (PBR's) that have been installed and exposed to harsh downhole environments for 20 + years create a need for innovative solutions.  Through this paper we will demonstrate how through proper planning and equipment selection the operator was able to successfully install a gas tight mechanical casing annulus packer in a tieback string. This provided mechanical isolation of the previous casing string that had been exposed to years of wear. Traditional solutions of a tieback seal stem stung into a PBR were not possible due to expected condition of the seal surface in the PBR from years of down hole exposure. The rigorous qualification and validation program of the packer led to its selection in this application. Acceptance criteria of ISO 14310: V0 was used as the basis for testing. This included testing in a casing joint that had been previously installed in a well for 25+ years, mimicking downhole environments for this application.  The annulus packer was installed integral to the tieback casing and activation was combined with subsequent installation of multi-lateral junction equipment. Requiring no dedicated runs for installation or activation provided additional value for the operator. The packer was tested as per well design criteria which allowed the operator to proceed with well construction and continue to new target with upmost confidence in barrier compliance and well integrity.}

	abstract		= {Drilling operations generate a wealth of digital data that can be examined to improve efficiencies. Downhole high-frequency accelerometers and gyro sensors have been around for years but were typically used to study single well intervals. Sensor data, matched to surface measurement, is being more routinely captured across multiple wells as costs have decreased. The authors have developed a platform and workflow allowing experts to use the downhole data native resolution easily. The authors will systematically use data analysis to link drilling dynamics and downhole tool function to system design, automated rig processes, and operating parameters.  The downhole sensor data, surface drilling data, and other relevant time-based and depth-based data streams must be cleaned, synced, and combined to provide a single source of data. This is not a trivial step due to various data quality issues such as sensor clock resets. The combined data is then loaded into a web-based viewer designed to allow for analysis at the native resolution of each data stream. The operator followed this process on ten wells of a new well design with a larger horizontal hole size to benchmark and improved performance in the horizontal interval.  Managing data of this size is not often in the realm of drilling expertise, leading to unusable or lost datasets. Data consistency, timeliness, and accessibility are essential to engineers and analysts but are often lacking. The net result is that engineers can't exploit the full resolution downhole sensor data, often causing analyses to end up with few answers. Many drilling phenomena like micro-stalling of the motor and high-frequency torsional oscillation are only identifiable with high-resolution downhole data. The operator used the described platform and workflow to find and characterize the drilling limiters in the drilling system and extends work first described in SPE 204099. Examples depicting downhole tool function, including failures, will show how downhole information is used to interpret surface observations and diagnose the drilling limiters at play over the wells.  Capturing and structuring high-frequency downhole sensor data builds on the traditional approach of drilling optimization using surface parameters and shock statistics. A dataset for analytics allows engineers and service companies to monitor downhole shocks and vibrations across wells and evaluate their effects concerning drilling parameters and procedures. Metrics beyond simple shock and vibration levels better assess drilling performance as the view into the downhole environment becomes clearer.}

	abstract		= {Stick-slip vibrations of drillstrings have been studied by researchers for several decades. The subject is gaining renewed interest as operating parameters for PDC bits have shifted to the stick-slip regime of higher bit weight and lower rotary speed for enhanced drilling performance. In Ledgerwood et al. (2010), stick-slip was identified as a primary cause of bit damage. The main objective of the current investigation is to answer the longstanding question: Do bit designs influence stick-slip behavior of the drilling system? Five prevailing industry perceptions reported in the literature are that anti-whirl bits, reduced exposure bits, and bits with bit-rock interaction number $\beta>1$ are less prone to stick-slip, while highly aggressive bits and worn bits are more prone to stick-slip. Although the phenomenological basis of these theories has been provided, validation in most cases is based on anecdotal evidence from the field. Data with diagnosis based on downhole measurements in a controlled environment are scarce. Consequently, conflicting opinions continue to exist about whether any of these theories work in reality.  To assess their validity, the five leading theories were reviewed and pairs of PDC bits were designed and manufactured. Each pair consisted of a bit with a standard design and a bit that embodied one of the theories. The bits were first tested in the laboratory to characterize their response. Full-scale wells were then drilled under controlled conditions using a research drill rig in Oklahoma. In these wells, only the operating parameters were varied while BHA, formation, and other variables were unchanged for a given bit pair. The downhole vibrations were measured with a new in-bit device and an industry-proven MWD vibration monitoring service.  The most important conclusion emerging from this study is that PDC bit design has a significant effect on stick-slip vibrations. While some of the theories held true, evidence from this study did not support others. The details of test results are provided and various aspects of bit design are discussed in an attempt to enhance the understanding of stick-slip mitigation.},

	abstract		= {The characteristics of a drill string system have an essential influence on the performance of directional drilling. The appropriate control method of a drill string is important to drilling efficiency and downhole operation safety. Therefore, based on a new mechanical rotary steerable tool (RST), this paper aims to analyze the Dynamic Characteristics of RST in Directional Drilling. First, considering the thrust force generated by the RST and bottom hole assembly (BHA), the governing vibration equations of a drill string system are established. Furthermore, connected with fields drilling parameters, including the effects of a new RST on a drill bit and wellbore, as the boundary and initial conditions, the dynamic characteristics of a drill string system are compared and studied in directional and straight drilling. The results show that the axial vibration of the drill string increases extremely in directional drilling process, while the weight on bit (WOB) and inclination force change in small range. Moreover, the torque and azimuth force tend to be stable soon, even its initial fluctuations are significantly. Also, the new RST can effectively enhance the steering capacity, increase the drilling efficiency, and improve drill bit force performance. The research results can provide reference for developing directional drilling technologies, including related tool design and optimization.}

	abstract		= {Bit whirl is well documented as a major cause of damage to polycrystalline-diamond-compact (PDC) drill bits and results in short runs, low rate of penetration (ROP), high cost per foot, poor hole quality, and downhole-tool damage. Hence, consistent lateral stability is highly desirable in PDC bits.  This paper presents a new method of producing PDC drill bits that reduce or eliminate bit whirl. Traditionally, attempts to design laterally stable PDC bits have assumed that the forces generated by the bit during stable drilling cause it to begin whirling. The new approach assumes that it is the response of the bit to forced motion off its center that causes whirl.  The new approach has been validated theoretically, in the laboratory, and in the field. Test results from a full-scale drilling rig indicate that this method is superior to existing methods at minimizing bit whirl.  This new method was validated successfully through an extensive field-test program undertaken in the northwest USA, involving high-speed downhole measurements from both conventional 7?-in.-diameter PDC drill bits and bits designed using this new method. The results demonstrated that the conventional PDC drill bits exhibited bit whirl throughout the run. The bits designed using the new method eliminated bit whirl completely.  The performance benefits of this new method were demonstrated in a 16-in.-bit section in a Middle Eastern field, where lateral vibrations are a significant problem. Before testing the new-method PDC bit, bit optimization led to the use of high imbalance force designs to minimize lateral vibration. The first test of the new method laterally stable PDC bit set field records for ROP, footage, and cost per foot compared with more than 50 runs with "antiwhirl" (Warren et al. 1990) designs, resulting in savings of more than USD 50,000 per run.  This paper demonstrates how use of the new method can eliminate whirl in both laboratory and field environments and deliver significant performance improvements over existing stability techniques.  This new method represents a significant step forward in the design of PDC bits to mitigate bit whirl, and it has been proved to reduce bit damage, increase run lengths, increase ROP, and deliver sizeable savings for operators.}

	abstract		= {High frequency torsional oscillation (HFTO) is still one of the most disruptive drilling dysfunctions we encounter. Vibrations are observed with fundamental frequencies as high as 400 Hz and torque sweeps from 0 to 7000 lbf-ft. The resulting damage includes drilling collar cracking, damaged electronics, and backed-off tools.  By measuring the amplitude and the fundamental frequency of this dysfunction, we present a model to characterize its drivers. This is a critical step in defining the mitigation strategies.  Although there are a multitude of drilling dynamics tools deployed to record these effects, the nature of HFTO, with large amplitude harmonics on top of the fundamental modes, means that simply deploying a sensor and data acquisition tool is not sufficient to characterize the dysfunction. There are critical requirements for these recorders in terms of sampling frequency and anti-aliasing filters, without which a unique interpretation of the dynamics is impossible.  We have a next-generation MWD tool that will detect HFTO. By calculating a fast fourier transform (FFT) in real time, it will also deliver a log of HFTO throughout the operation, that can be delivered to the driller in real time.  With this we have developed and demonstrated a suite of mitigation strategies. These are specific to the type of HFTO detected and include increasing the collar speed or reducing the WOB (for Type 2) or reducing the rate at which the WOB is increased (for Type 1). We also show that by changing the contact points on the tool to reduce the side force (friction), the operator can mitigate the Type 2 HFTO and achieve a considerable improvement on this drilling dysfunction and its impact.}

	abstract		= {During the advanced development phase of a push-the-bit rotary steerable system (RSS), downhole drilling dynamics were captured utilizing high-frequency embedded drilling dynamics sensors distributed throughout the bottom-hole assembly (BHA).  The RSS development testing was conducted in a challenging pocket of the Delaware Basin in the Permian Region of North America. This specific Delaware area has proven difficult to drill with conventional steerable motors due to rapid shoulder wear on the bit and sliding difficulties (Sugiura et al.2022).  The initial RSS BHAs were designed based on the directional objectives of the well. As the runs and wells progressed, the multiple embedded drilling dynamics sensor data, BHA/bit component wear and reliability, and drilling performance were all analyzed. From these learnings, systematic BHA changes were implemented and measured. This process continued until the drilling pace, reliability and repeatability were at an acceptable level for the project.  This paper details the drilling dynamics, drilling parameters, BHA configurations, formations, and logic for BHA/drilling parameter changes in the 12 $\frac{1}{4}$-in. intermediate section.}

The presence of the 2nd mode shape of torsional vibration was observed and linked to the failure. Conditions that lead to a 2nd mode shape being triggered and sustained are discussed in addition to recommendations to prevent fatigue failures.  2nd mode shape torsional vibration is a standing wave with two nodes created along the drill string, with the first one being the top drive and 2nd located along the drill string. The drill pipe experiences the highest torque fluctuations in the rotational nodes during torsional vibration.  A high-resolution drilling dynamics recorder was utilized to record a spectrum of torsional vibration frequencies, confirming the presence of the 2nd mode shape of torsional vibration. The multiple degrees of freedom spring-mass model was used to identify the node location, which was later compared to the locations of the actual twist-offs.  The presence of the 2nd mode torsional vibration, its transition from the fundamental mode to the 2nd mode, and the conditions for the transition to happen were observed.  Recommendations were developed on how to recognize the 2nd mode shape with the surface instrumentation, on the drill string design, and preventive inspection.  Knowing the location of the node gives a possibility of selective inspection of the drill pipes once the 2nd mode shape was observed while drilling, minimizing the risk of fatigue failures. Also, the drill string design could be revised by increasing drill pipe strength within the nodes. The twist-off locations were found to match the calculated location of the node caused by the 2nd mode shape with a high degree of accuracy.}

	abstract		= {Bottom hole assembly (BHA) designs were assessed in field trials for their ability to achieve critical low inclination requirements, while simultaneously enabling high drill rates. Because angle has historically been controlled by reducing weight on bit (WOB), these are often competing priorities. The use of real time surveillance of mechanical specific energy (MSE) provided unique insights into the bit dysfunction that occurs with many practices used to control angle. These quantitative insights supported the development of BHA and operating practices that maintained low angle while also achieving major gains in drilling performance.  The McGinness Hills field in Lander County Nevada is a geothermal operation with wells drilled in hard metamorphic and crystalline formations. Wellbore inclinations must be maintained below 2.0 degrees in the critical 20 inch interval in order to allow use of lineshaft pumps, which is challenging in the required hole sizes and rock hardness. Formation strengths are similar to petroleum operations in the Rockies and West Texas.  Pendulum and packed-hole assemblies were tested, and straight motors and slick assemblies were used for corrections. Well build rates were assumed to be controlled by the three-point curvature in the lower assembly and stabilizer placement was modified to control this curvature. The effectiveness of the curvature control as WOB was increased was evaluated from inclination measurements. Real time MSE analysis was used to manage bit operating performance and to determine the root causes of bit dysfunction.  The results demonstrated that packed-hole assemblies could be designed that controlled inclination while enabling 2-3 times higher WOB, and that the use of pendulum assemblies should be eliminated. Packed assemblies drilled 87\% faster. The increased WOB resulted in higher drill rates, major reduction in whirl and extended bit life, which are equally important performance objectives in hard rock drilling. The use of MSE surveillance allowed the physical processes to be understood deterministically, so that the philosophical design principles can be applied in other petroleum and geothermal operations.},

	abstract		= {Light density drilling fluids with hollow glass beads (HGB) are growing in applications for drilling depleted formations with minimal losses and increasing rate of penetration. However, there is a lack of studies on how best to utilize typical solids control equipment, as current practices and procedures based on barite weighted muds are inefficient. We report a systematic full-scale test program to study and optimize solids control efficiency with shale shaker, hydrocyclone and centrifuge with such fluids.  A non-aqueous-based hollow glass bead drilling fluid was formulated in the lab and a large batch ($>$40bbl) was prepared and tested using field scale solids control equipment. The inlet and effluent streams were monitored for density, particle size distribution, retort, rheology, and rheological properties and evaluated to determine the optimal equipment conditions to maximize solids control efficiency while minimizing loss of beads in the discharge stream. Variables included shaker screen sizes, flow rates and deck angles, hydrocyclone flowrates and operating pressures, centrifuge flowrates, differential speeds and other parameters. The amount of glass beads in the fluid was also varied.  The drilling fluid was contaminated with a variety of sized solids which mimic drill solids. Based on the data gathered, effective procedures were developed for monitoring hollow glass beads and drill solids in each stream. Through the systematic test program, conditions could be identified to achieve high solids control efficiency from the shale shaker, the hydrocyclone, and the centrifuge. This was achieved at hollow glass beads concentrations of around 11\% and 22\% by volume. While some previous field experiences had indicated severe challenges with centrifuge usage with these fluids, effective centrifuge operation could be demonstrated once the proper settings were identified. Overall, the testing results showed that most of the drill solids can be removed using conventional solids control equipment and fluid properties (e.g. rheology, fluid loss, etc.) can be maintained at desired levels without the loss of any significant amount of beads with the discharged solids.  Since the beads are lighter than base oil, their behavior in the solids control equipment is quite different from conventional solids. As such, equipment procedures and conventional settings had to be updated or changed. It was demonstrated that high solids control efficiency can be achieved even at high bead concentrations. This work addresses a barrier in the field application of these fluids and points towards practices that allow optimizing the application by minimizing drilling fluid dilution.}

This paper presents a method to increase the reliability of hole-opening BHAs by optimally matching the bit and reamer. The weight and torque distribution between the bit and reamer is predicted using a stationary load model. New quality load curves facilitate the evaluation of bit-reamer combinations in a user-friendly way. The model and the load curves are validated on a unique set of field data, enabling determination of the model's accuracy.  The model is based on the mechanical specific energies at the bit and at the reamer. The model assumes the RPM and rate of penetration to be constant, the BHA is rigid in the axial and torsional directions and the lateral movement is blocked. Quality load curves are deduced that depict the load distribution in one plot. The model is validated on a unique data set that includes several high-precision measuring tools placed along the drill string. The unconfined compressive strength over depth that usually is not measured in other runs is available. The data set enables precise determination of the axial forces and torques directly at the bit and at the reamer. The observed mechanical specific energy, drilling efficiency, and aggressiveness of both cutting tools over depth are measured.  The model and the quality curves are used to predict the weight and torque distribution depending on the formation type at the bit and at the reamer. A comparison of the prediction to the measured data shows that the weight distribution is predicted with an error of 2\% and the torque distribution is predicted with an error of 10.8\%. The model accuracy is determined by introducing uncertain parameters into the model. The load predictions are again compared to the measured data. Using the coarse parameter set, the mean prediction error increases to 13\%, which is very good, considering the simplifying assumptions of the model.  The validated model and the new quality curves enable an optimal choice of bit and reamers. The presented approach is fast and user-friendly and perfect for an application in advisory software in the well-planning phase. The increased reliability due to less mechanical overloads leads to reduced maintenance costs and less non-productive time of the reamer BHAs.}

	abstract		= {High-Frequency-Torsional Oscillations (HFTO) generate dynamic loads that can damage drilling tools, resulting in, for example cracks, twist-offs or broken electronics. They are triggered by the interaction of bits and rocks and force operators to reduce rotary speed (RPM) and weight on bit (WOB) losing drilling performance in the process. Recently, a full-scale drilling test rig was proven to generate verified HFTO behavior under laboratory conditions (Everhard et. al. 2023). This rig allows for a comprehensive study of the influences of bit characteristics on HFTO for the first time. This paper presents methods to qualify bit features to suppress HFTO. Effective HFTO influencing properties are identified and discussed.  The full-scale laboratory test rig drills rocks in a pressurized rock chamber. ROP, WOB, RPM, pressure, bit type and rock type can be varied. High-frequency measurement instrumentation, including new in-bit sensing, record the tangential accelerations and dynamic torque at various positions in the laboratory rig. The type of excited torsional vibrations match vibrations in the field indicating that learnings in the lab translate to the field. To study the influence of bit and operating parameters on HFTO, PDC-bits of varying design are used to drill rocks under varying pressures, RPMs and WOB. The data are used to develop evaluation methods to rank bit-rock combinations with regards to the stability and severity of the generated vibrations.  Stability maps relating RPM, WOB, and vibration proved to be a good measure to reliably identify HFTO and rank bit-rock combinations and applied operating parameters, by their susceptibility to HFTO. Bit properties, such as cutter shape, cutter placement or rock type control the energy intake per vibration cycle and, hence, the excitation of torsional vibrations. The operating parameter space indicating stable drilling states can be maximized by properly choosing bit features. Rock types triggering HFTO are identified using segmented core tests. When HFTO is present and fully developed, the severity of vibrations scales with the angular velocity of the bit (RPM) but not with the WOB. If HFTO is absent, WOB and RPM act as an "on-off" switch to HFTO. The threshold of WOB and RPM triggering HFTO is established for bit-rock combinations. The stable operating zone can be influenced by adding damping devices to the BHA. The findings also result in recommendations for operating BHAs in the field.  Studying HFTO in a full-scale laboratory environment using the presented methods enables the development of robust and reliable HFTO countermeasures. Major influences on HFTO are identified and scientifically proven; understanding these characteristics will result in HFTO suppressing bits and tools. Ultimately, HFTO mitigation allows drilling engineers to optimize drilling parameters and reduce drilling time while simultaneously decreasing tool-failure probability and associated NPT and costs.}

A key objective of this SIT was to verify and de-risk tools and techniques prior to their potential deployment in an offshore target well.  A deepwater well, located offshore Brazil, was used as the basis for the design of the SIT program. The objective of the well operation was to permanently isolate the production tubing and the A-annulus in which a flatpack containing 2x chemical injection lines and 1x electrical line is present. To ensure the flatpack would not provide a leakage pathway it had to be cut into pieces prior to cementing the A-annulus.  A completion string mimicking the main features of the well was designed utilizing 10 \textthreequarters{}in. casing, 6-5/8in. tubing with a flatpack and a restriction created by the downhole safety valve (DHSV). The completion was installed inside a large diameter test well and thereafter the technologies to be verified were deployed using wireline and rigless coiled tubing interventions.  After installation of the test well completion, the performance of various technologies was investigated through the following operations: \begin{bulletedlist}\item Flatpack detection with four different e-line ultrasonic \& electro-magnetic tools \item Flatpack ablation with custom designed oriented shaped charges utilizing two different gun designs run on wireline\item Through tubing cement placement utilizing a Perf, Wash \& Cement technique deployed on coiled tubing\item Coiled tubing cement mill out using a motor, bit and underreamer able to pass the DHSV and remove the cement plug from the tubing\item Evaluation of the annular barrier quality using a cement bond logging tool\item Recovery of the well completion, keeping the A-annulus barrier intact for subsequent inspection at surface and comparison to the log results \end{bulletedlist} The performance of state-of-the-art technologies that can enable rig-less through-tubing plug and abandonment (P\&A) utilizing wireline and coiled tubing interventions have been investigated and de-risked through an SIT executed in a test well completion mimicking an actual offshore deepwater well.}

However, proper operating conditions (i.e.\ low rotary speed and high weight on bit) and new technology for vibration control (anti-whirl PDC bits and a soft-torque rotary system) can successfully extend the application of PDC bits to harder formations. This conclusion is based on numerical modelling of PDC bit/drillstring assemblies and is supported by recent developments in PDC bit technology and torsional vibration control systems. The PDC bit model is fully dynamic and three-dimensional and is used to simulate normal rotary drilling. Sensitivity analyses of different PDC bit designs show bit-induced torsional, axial and lateral vibrations. Moreover, these analyses show that conventional PDC bits tend to whirl backward, resulting in reduced penetration rates and bit life. Anti-whirl PDC bits effectively reduce this tendency when run under the proper operating conditions of low rotary speed and high weight on bit.  Downhole measurements and numerical analyses clearly demonstrate that, during normal rotary drilling, the drillstring vibrates in several modes of vibration. Downhole vibrations frequently result in inconsistent bit performance, drillstring failure, problems with directional control, lack of measurement while drilling (MWD) signal detection and borehole instability. In particular in harder formations severe vibrations cause particular in harder formations severe vibrations cause premature polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit premature polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit failure. This has led to the generally accepted field practice that PDC bits are run mainly in soft to practice that PDC bits are run mainly in soft to medium-hard formations. This is rather disappointing, considering artificial diamond cutters can cut very hard rock under controlled conditions. The work presented in this paper was initiated to investigate the presented in this paper was initiated to investigate the effects of PDC-bit-induced vibrations and to address the problems associated with drilling harder formations.  For a better understanding of the complex phenomena experienced during drilling, numerical phenomena experienced during drilling, numerical simulation of the drillstring behaviour is essential. In general, the computer programs for drillstring dynamics reported in literature deal with boundary conditions at the bit only or use a simple bit model. The drilling motion of the bit, including formation removal, is not taken into account. On the other hand, dedicated PDC bit models are kinematic, i.e. the bit motion is prescribed, and two-dimensional, and therefore cannot be used for the investigation of the dynamic behaviour of PDC bits. Recently a three-dimensional PDC bit model was presented by Behr et al. Again it is a kinematic presented by Behr et al. Again it is a kinematic model, although it is possible to compute the cutting forces for more complex bit motions like bit whirl. Brett uses an experimentally derived PDC bit model and a simple mass-spring model of the torsional drillstring motion.},

But is whirl still the major cause of PDC bit damage in today's applications? This paper reports on a recent field study in which downhole vibrations were measured using a newly available in-bit vibration-monitoring device. The focus of this study was to understand today's North American vertical conventional rotary applications. In addition, four wells were also drilled using a research drill rig in Oklahoma. In these tests, PDC bits, BHAs, and operating parameters were varied to document their effect on downhole vibrations. In these four wells, vibration measurements from the new in-bit measuring device were validated against a commercially available and industry-proven MWD vibration monitoring service. Also, a computer model that accounts for the coupled response of bits and BHAs was run for selected tests in field wells and the research drilling rig. The models agreed well with the measured cases in both whirl and stick-slip. The model also allowed the authors to confirm that high-frequency torsional oscillations (4-9 Hz) which we observed were, as a previous industry paper suggests, due to BHA torsional resonance.  The results of this study indicate that the most common field vibration today in hard rock PDC drilling is stick-slip, not whirl, in the target test region. In field tests, stick-slip was almost exclusively observed. For typical field applications with a surface rotary speed of about 70, we have measured peak downhole RPM during the slip phase as high as 500. This paper will report on these findings, document damage resulting from stick-slip, and suggest potential solutions to mitigate downhole vibrations.},

In this paper, data acquisition tools with high-frequency sample rates and the data processing are introduced. Based on high-frequency data, progress of drilling dynamics is summarized, including new understandings of low-frequency drillstring dynamics, high-frequency torsional oscillations (HFTOs), and high-frequency axial oscillations (HFAOs) and new findings for the coupling of vibrations and motions, as well as models and simulation methods to deeply comprehend high-frequency dynamics of drillstring. High-frequency measurements have been used for enabling drillers to improve drill performance, especially for field decision making, BHA selection, and bit design, usually through the ways of minimizing vibrations to obtain high-efficient drilling conditions, the high-frequency response near bit can also be used for lithology identification during drilling. Though there still exists a gap between research perspective and drilling practice, the industry of high-frequency measurements has gotten off a good start, which has huge potential to avoid nonproductive time thereupon reducing drilling cost in the future.},

	abstract		= {The severe lateral vibration and impact of drill string will not only cause the damage of drill string but also have bad effects on the quality of directional drilling operation. It is difficult to control lateral vibration amplitude and impact intensity even with advanced measurement apparatus. So it is feasible to use a theoretic method to analyze and predict lateral vibration in order to adjust drilling parameters in realtime. On the basis of beam-column series and spring-concentrated mass model, a new analytical model is established to realize the control of lateral vibration and impact.  The severe lateral vibration and impact of drill string will not only cause the fatigue and fracture of drill string [1\textendash{}2], but also broaden hole and change side force and bending angle of bit which lead to damage quality of a directional well [3]. But it is difficult to control lateral vibration amplitude and impact intensity because the phenomenon of lateral vibration and impact of drill string can not be observed at surface without the expensive MWD (measurement while drilling) apparatus [4\textendash{}5]. In order to improve the control and prediction method of lateral vibration comparatively, this paper tries to attest the feasibility to use a theoretic method to analyze and predict lateral vibration and impact. The present drill string dynamic methods mainly use finite element method [6\textendash{}7] which needs too complex calculation to be used in drilling field. Consequently, it is necessary to establish a simple analytical model of lateral vibration and impact to design and adjust drilling parameters in real-time. On the basis of beam-column series and spring-concentrated mass model, a new analytical model is established which consider many factors, such as: BHA (bottom-hole assemble), WOB (weight on bit) fluctuation, ROB (rotation of bit).},

Experiments of Taylor bubble countercurrent behavior in an eccentric 6 in.\ \texttimes{} 4 in.\ annulus were conducted. Fluid rheology, annulus inclination, and internal pipe rotational speed were varied to provide a clearer understanding of Taylor bubble physics under non-Newtonian countercurrent flow and its implications for effectively managing upward gas migration that can occur in a wellbore during drilling operations in fractured or vugular rock formations. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to estimate the velocity of Taylor bubble in vertical annuli with downward fluid flow and a new closure relation for distribution parameter, $C_0$, was proposed. The drift flux model embedded in the new gas migration velocity model was applied to simulate the dynamics of bullheading/PMCD. Good agreement between the model and published data was obtained. The effect of different bullheading rates on surface pressure and gas fraction in PMCD operation was examined.}

	abstract		= {Addressing gas migration in a static mud column during the shut-in period is a major concern in Pressurized Mud Cap Drilling (PMCD). Significant discrepancies have been found between the field data and existing correlations for gas migration velocity, since the latter are based on either small-scale experiments or overly simplified assumptions, resulting in overly conservative estimations. To meet the Light Annular Mud (LAM) requirement for managing gas migration and to monitor the transient pressure experienced throughout the PMCD operation, an improved gas migration velocity model was developed by combining the equation of motion (bubble flow) and Taylor-bubble correlation (slug flow). In the bubble flow model, the effects of non-Newtonian fluid properties and drill pipe rotation are considered through a modified drag coefficient ($C_D$) that incorporates the bubble Reynolds number ($Re_b$) and dimensionless shear rate ($Sr$). The effect of bubble swarm is taken into account through a void fraction ($\alpha_g$) term. The slug flow model is based on a Taylor bubble correlation in terms of E\"{o}tv\"{o}s number ($Eo$) and inverse viscosity number ($Nf$). For the first time, the dependence of Taylor bubble velocity on drill pipe rotation has been shown and correlated as a function of $Sr$. Predictions of the gas migration velocities in PMCD operations are made and successfully compared with the existing models and test-well experimental data. The drift flux model embedded in the new gas migration velocity model was applied to simulate the gas migration in a test well. Good agreement between the model and measured pressure results in the full-scale test-well experiments can be obtained. Its companion work (Liu et al., 2023) provides the design and calculation method of key parameters in bullheading/PMCD operations}

Operators desire advanced drilling simulation software that can mimic reality and yet be practical for daily operations. At the same time, academic researchers are devoting time and effort to develop robust and accurate models of every module of an integrated drilling environment but are challenged with translating their original contributions into the operational setting. We seek to solve both of these issues through a distinctive collaboration consortium based on an open-source paradigm. We describe and propose an advanced drilling simulation developed through a joint industry consortium at Texas A\&M University. The simulator provides free access to sophisticated and reliable drilling dynamics solvers. This includes drill string dynamics, torque and drag analysis, geologic modeling, hydraulics, and wellbore pressure modeling, visualization, and operator interfaces. The simulator is written in C++ and is built on top of high-performance open source libraries that leverages parallel computing, GPU acceleration, multibody, and computational fluid dynamics solvers as well as other tools (see figure for further details). We will assist industry and academic users to employ our open-source tool. In addition, we will help said parties further develop our framework into proprietary and protected business software via the addition of custom functionality. The simulator core was successfully developed and has been used to model horizontal drilling, while providing near real-time performance. The framework has been used in several applications successfully, including modeling shallow horizontal jetting, rock drilling, and steering; as well as reconstructing spatial data from high fidelity downhole signals for borehole evaluation, and the development of improved downhole navigation algorithms. We believe that a collaborative development effort between academia and industry will bring solutions to complex modeling needs faster and more economically than any individual endeavor. To this end, the authors will also show how one can partner with Texas A\&M University to obtain access to the open-source enabled drilling simulation framework and platform to collaborate, improve and create solutions for new and existing problems.}

A roller cone bit drills by the action of its teeth which form successive small craters in the bottom of the hole.  A vast amount of research has been done on the crater formation by a single tooth.  However, the design and application of roller cone bits is still based mainly on the `design and try'' approach.  The ability to evaluate the number of teeth that are in contact with the bottom hole, their instantaneous position and the velocity is very important in roller cone bit design.  It is essential that the single tooth action be recognized as part of the whole bit action.  This paper attempts to develop an analytical tool to quantify the tooth action.  It is based on tests, geometry analysis and statistics.}

Thus, the cutting structure of the bit together with their movement is represented by the time-sequence of the coordinates of the several thousand points. Hence, the computer simulates the roller bit.  In the simulation, the bottom hole that changes with drilling is represented, according to the sequence of time, as a series of time points. And the bottom hole at each time point is represented, according to space, as tens of thousands of points, whose 3-D compound coordinates are used to express the shape and size of the bottom hole at an arbitrary time. The changes of the bottom hole with drilling are described by a recurrence model made up of the bottom hole at each time point. Hence the reproduction of the bottom hole is on computer.  The well bore is dealt with the same principle as the bottom hole.  The interaction between the roller bit and the rock is represented by the balance model of the vertical and the lateral interactions.  The index, inclination, the shape and size of rock fragile breakage by a contacting tooth at any time are calculated by the fragile criterion model and the rock breakage model. The craters with various shapes are formed by the rock fragile breakage and the amount of the rock occupied by the tooth directly.  BRIAS, the simulation software thus set up, can be used to analyse all the interactions in the process of drilling. Detailed experiment data have proved that the simulation software is able to well reflect the effects of the subtle differences of bit structure, WOB and rock properties upon the rotation rate and the torque of the bit.}

	abstract		= {Studies indicate that the interaction between the drill bit and rock formations induces vibrations along the bottom hole assembly ({BHA}). Parameters such as weight on bit (WOB) and rotation speed affect the engagement of the cutters in the rock, otherwise known as depth of cut (DOC). DOC is crucial for bit stability; a poor {BHA} design combined with a suboptimal choice of DOC can lead to axial, torsional, and lateral instabilities (bit bounce, stick-slip, and bit whirling phenomena). Optimizing the bit design to address these vibrations is vital for improved drilling performance. Both experimental studies in the lab and numerical simulations are essential tools to test and improve bit design before real-world drilling.  In this work, a transient bit-rock interaction model is implemented to study the evolution of cutting and friction forces on each individual cutter, whether it is a cylindrical or shaped cutter. Specific models are introduced based on laboratory scratch tests, where the performance of each shaped cutter type is related to its main geometrical characteristics. These elementary forces are combined to provide the overall response of the bit. It accounts for axial, torsional, and lateral motions of the bit as well as the possible transition between different rock layers that generally trigger bit instability. This model is coupled with a time-domain dynamics model of the drill string to examine the implications of the cutting process on the {BHA} vibration. Experimental lab data on a drill bit are used as a basis to calibrate the model. The experimental measurements are then complemented with the simulation results to have an in-depth understanding of the bit behavior.  Comparisons of lab and simulation results showed a good agreement for WOB, torque on bit (TOB), and lateral acceleration. Based on these results, the numerical simulations allowed investigation of the cutter elementary forces, ranking them in terms of work rate and durability. Moreover, the simulations showed how bit whirl can propagate upwards in the string, creating lateral vibrations in the rotating shaft. With the collected information on the bit behavior, an application is carried out on a realistic {BHA} and wellbore trajectory, and the vibration levels are analyzed along the whole {BHA}.  This scope of work has many implementations, testing different combinations of drill bits, rock formations, and drill string assemblies. It can be used either as a pre-analysis tool to optimize the bit and {BHA} designs, or as a post-analysis tool to understand a specific vibration event and prevent recurrence. The addition of new elementary cutting models for different shaped cutters provides other axes of bit design improvements, where the type, number, and placement of the shaped cutters can be investigated.}

This paper aims to demonstrate how drilling parameter optimisation in real-time provides a drilling team with an Edge based solution that can continuously improve performance and avoid problems without the need of subject matter experts. Results from testing the Edge-System on multiple wells from several operators are presented related to auto-calibration of real-time prediction models and for optimization of drilling parameters. This system based on cloud technology with Model based reasoning in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is able to give real-time and forward advice for operational parameters, ref SPE-204074-MSThe key enabler for such system is "automatic" auto-calibration of models which is used for multiple forward-looking and what-if calculations to find optimal drilling parameters within the well envelope ahead.  A simplified configuration has been made so that the rig-team can operate and maintain the system without the need for subject matter experts. "Automatic" Auto-calibration at stable conditions and/or during ramping conditions removes the need for subject matter experts. Such a system helps reduce operational costs as the rig-team can operate the system without the need of back-office support. Comparison will be made to document operational improvements.}

	abstract		= {Bonding to casing material characterization is a topic of interest in the context of well barrier evaluation. There is a consolidated need directed to log data interpreters to answer questions related to the type of material present in the casing annuli of a given well. The objective of this work is to explore the possibility to provide a complementary answer to current general acoustic impedance and attenuation practice.  We reiterate that knowledge about the density of the annuli material can reduce the well barrier evaluation uncertainty. We are describing and exemplifying a rapid method to estimate the "pseudo \textendash{} density" of the material in the annuli at the time of data acquisition. We define "pseudo-density" as the ratio between estimated impedance (from ultrasonic pulse-echo) and annuli apparent velocities (from ultrasonic oblique incidence techniques). Resulting "pseudo-density" maps are constrained with prior information from geology, logging, and drilling data. This allows the interpreter to judge the uncertainty in the current interpretation practice and contextualization of the annuli material into the borehole reality.  The examples provided show that when the underlying physics principles are met, the results are clear and a robust interpretation at scale along the entire logged path is possible. The estimated complementary results are affected by inherent errors and uncertainty associated with acoustic impedance and velocity estimation. However, using prior knowledge information, intervals with high uncertainty (such as unusually high impedances or large errors in the velocity estimation) are flagged providing the interpreter with information background easy to be used for final delivery.  Along with standard applications, the proposed method includes the basic mandatory tool for evaluating, validating, and incorporating the forecasted growth based on nuclear integrity logging behind the casing evaluation techniques.}

This could be done using an eccentric reaming device or an expandable concentric underreamer; both are called reamer in the following. In RWD assemblies the weight applied to the BHA is distributed between the bit and reamer. To ensure optimized performance drilling, itâ€™s necessary to know the distribution of weight as well as the distribution of torque in the BHA. For any calculation of drill string dynamics or tool durability the loads applied to the BHA are an essential input. The effort required to measure all loads while reaming is rather high so there is a need to calculate the weight and torque distribution from as few measurements as possible. Based on aggressiveness and mechanical specific energy (MSE), an analytical method is shown to calculate the load distribution in RWD BHAs. Therefore a new approach to aggressiveness is introduced for calculation at the bit and reamer. By combination of aggressiveness and MSE, it can be shown how to derive weight and torque distributions in a RWD BHA. Effects of formation changes or different drilling diameters on the rate of penetration (ROP) can be calculated, as well as changes in the load distribution. To prevent the reamer from disruptive weight and torque, depth of cut control (DOCC) technology can be applied at the bit as described by Thomson (2008). How this technology affects the reamer, even if only applied at the bit will be shown as well. Based on data from a field test where weight and torque on bit and on reamer were measured simultaneously the accuracy/validity of the method is shown.}

Cutting forces at the reamer are known widely in the industry to cause additional vibrations of the drillstring that could harm the bottomhole assembly (BHA). This causes unnecessary downtime at the rigsite and increases costs. Expandable underreamers have very limited design envelopes for the optimization of their cutter layout. Most have only three blades and high-profile angles. Common polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits have five or more blades and generate most of the cutting forces at their inner cutters. Reamers, due to their resulting forces, have significantly different characteristics compared to bits. By using appropriate bit-dynamics simulation software it is possible to explain the reasons for these different bit and reamer characteristics. An in-depth study of the cutting forces enables a better understanding of the mechanics of vibration excitation, especially for underreamers.  Dynamic cutting force models for bits and reamers have been developed based on the results of cutting force analyses. These models contain weight, torque, and residual side force. They were implemented into a highly sophisticated drillstring model using finite-element analysis. Dynamics simulations in time domain of complete drillstrings resulting from the cutting forces at the bit and reamer are shown. Interactions of the pilot bit and reamer coupled by the BHA are also investigated using this model.  A field test was conducted using a hydraulically expandable underreamer. During this test, simultaneous dynamics measurements where taken at the bit and reamer in vertical and directional well sections. The measurements validate the simulation results.}

For this reason many studies on torque \& drag modeling have been performed. In this regard different approaches have been used; the difference in these approaches is often on how to include bending stiffness and shearing forces in the T\&D calculations. These approaches are (1) the effect of shear forces calculations with the assumption of continuous contact of the wellbore wall and the drillstring as well as constant curvature trajectory, (2) the effect of bending stiffness and shearing forces calculations with assuming of clearance between drillstring and wellbore-wall and (3) the effect of bending moment and shearing forces, assuming continuous contact of the pipe and wellbore-wall and using a non-constant curvature trajectory in which the first and second derivatives of the curve exist (i.e. spline type trajectories).  This paper consists of two main parts: first a review on literatures on the subject of stiff-string T\&D will be considered. Secondly, an approach will be discussed in which despite of the assumption of constant curvature trajectory and full-contact of pipe and wellbore wall, the effect of bending stiffness on torque and drag calculations are considered. The simple and robust stiff-string model is implemented in two example wells in order to find out the importance of the stiff-string calculations.}

	abstract		= {It is well accepted that torque and drag calculations are essential for well construction applications. To the authors' knowledge, the calculations are performed based on the concepts of the soft string model. This approach enables the wellbore designer to determine torque and other forces in the drillstring. While several modifications of the soft string model have been proposed and implemented in commercial software, the model mainly used in the oil and gas drilling industry is the static soft string model. As such, not only the string bending stiffness is neglected, but also it is assumed that the string is motionless and the direction of motion changes by merely changing the sign of friction coefficient. Clearly, there is a strong need for including acceleration effects in the soft string model to permit analysis of tripping operations and more accurate evaluation of the drillstring loading and consequently, the rig equipment (hoisting system, etc.).  In this paper, an improved dynamic soft string model is proposed that accounts for drillstring motion in 2D and 3D wellbores. This mathematical model explains how to compute forces along a moving drillstring or casing. The aims of this model are: 1) to analyze dynamic drillstring behavior, 2) to estimate local contact forces, and 3) to predict the effect of different tripping velocity profiles on axial and lateral contact forces. A system of equations for drillstring translational motion is solved using numerical methods. A computer code has been developed for practical design calculations.  The improved dynamic soft string model can be used to determine surface load and contact force as functions of time and measured depth. This model is also applied to predict surface load and contact forces in tripping operations. In particular, the model is implemented for drillpipe in two different 2D wellbores: horizontal and S-shaped, and a 3D wellbore while tripping in and out of the hole. As expected, the surface load vs. time plot shows a similar trend of tripping accelerations. Depending on the well path shape, drillstring properties, tripping acceleration, and velocity profile, the maximum dynamic loads can be in the range of 4-40\% higher compared to the conventional soft string model. In addition, results for two different tripping velocity profiles (trapezoidal and parabolic) are compared. The maximum surface load is up to 4\% higher with trapezoidal velocity profile which is not significant, because both velocity profiles provide 90 ft displacement. It is noted that the governing parameter for the maximum load needed is the maximum tripping acceleration, not the maximum velocity.  Improved dynamic soft string model will have significant impact on well path shape, drillstring design, drillpipe failure analysis, tripping operations optimization, and automatic control of the drawworks.}

The operator requested the hole be drilled with hole enlargement while drilling (HEWD) tools in a single run, with real-time logging tools. This technique would eliminate the requirement for extra 8\textonehalf{}\textquotedblright{} pilot hole thus significantly reduce rig-days.  Designing a robust and durable BHA for the 1370m long directional run demands intricate planning. To ensure the three cutting structures would synchronize and work in harmony, a pre-job FEA-based modeling system was used to investigate the dynamic drilling behavior of the BHA. The results of simulations from the initial BHA predicted very high vibrations which could potentially result in tool damage. A BHA optimization analysis was then conducted to enhance the BHA design to eliminate vibration issues. The simulation results of the optimized BHA design exhibited measurable reduction in vibration levels.  The operator implemented the recommended BHA and a total of 1371m was successfully drilled and opened in one run, in just four days. All directional requirements were met and a good set of survey and log data was transmitted up the well without issues. Compared with the traditional two run approach, the single run yielded a 25\\% time savings to the operator. No vibrations were recorded and the BHA was pulled at section TD with no significant wear on the three cutting structures. There were no issues running casing, which implies good borehole quality.}

	abstract		= {Various stabilizer types are used in the industry, such as bladed stabilizers with straight or spiral blades, roller-reamers, and other emergent forms. Their designs are proved, via many in-field measurements, to have a significant impact on vibration levels. Although experimental data is extremely valuable to rank the available design options, testing the different stabilizers can be costly and sometimes risky. In addition,in-field conditions can be difficult to control making the comparisons between stabilizers even more complicated. Assessing the design impact using numerical simulations represents an interesting alternative to provide objective comparisons based on tests in a controlled environment.  When a stabilizer is rotating, the contact forces between its different blades and the wellbore are transient.  A static approach like torque and drag or directional models is then insufficient to properly investigate the stabilizer's design characteristics. Therefore, a time-domain dynamics approach is adopted in this work. A detailed modeling of bladed stabilizers including the blade geometry (number of blades, spirality, and blade width) and friction characteristics are introduced in an existing time-domain model. These characteristically are used to compute the contact forces between the wellbore and each individual blade.  This numerical model is applied to quantify the effect of stabilizer design in terms of vibration, from straight blades to highly spiraled blades. First, a parametric study of blade design and wellbore inclination effects on stabilizer vibrations is presented by considering different stabilizers in straight well conditions.  Simulations of an actual drill string configuration in an unconventional well is discussed. For vertical,curved, and horizontal sections, the acceleration levels, contact forces, and rotation speeds are investigated.  These analyses can constitute guidelines about stabilizer design to minimize vibrations.  The novelty of this work is to introduce the geometry details of the stabilizers in the time-domain dynamics to differentiate designs in terms of likelihood to trigger vibrations.}

	abstract		= {This paper describes how high-density cesium/potassium (Cs/K) formate fluids were successfully utilised from reservoir drilling to upper completion installation in five productive Martin Linge high-rate gas wells. Four wells were completed with openhole gravel pack and one with standalone sand screens.  The gravel packing operation marks what is considered to be the highest density carrier fluid openhole gravel pack successfully completed worldwide, with SG 2.06. A complex operation under near-high-pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) conditions, including managed pressure drilling (MPD), overbalanced screen running and openhole gravel packing, was simplified by utilising the same fluid throughout the operation.  Cs/K formate reservoir drilling fluid and screen-running fluid were designed with biopolymeric additives and minimal calcium carbonate bridging particles. Clear Cs/K formate brine (i.e., without biopolymeric additives and particles) was chosen as gravel pack carrier fluid. The use of Cs/K formate fluids for all stages of the operation reduced the complexity of transitioning between the operational stages. In addition, the reservoir was only exposed to one filtrate without application of damaging weighting solids.  The drilling fluid contributed to successful MPD and delivered wells with very good hole quality in the reservoir, which consisted of interbedded sandstone, coal stringers and shale. The shale stabilising properties of concentrated formate brine\textendash{}based fluids provided acceptable conditions for extended openhole time and allowed additional logging runs, including pore pressure measurements, under near-HP/HT conditions before running the screens. One bottom-up cleanout was conducted before the screen-running fluid was circulated in and the screens installed. The spurt and seepage losses were low throughout the drilling and screen running phases. No breaker treatment was required in any of the wells. All wells have proven to have good initial productivity and high well productive efficiency as expected.  The record-breaking openhole gravel pack operations performed with the high fluid densities required in Equinor's Martin Linge field have set a new standard for completing in challenging high-pressure environments.}

	abstract		= {Despite advances in Measurement-While-Drilling / Logging-While-Drilling (MWD/LWD) technologies, the oil \& gas industry has until recently lacked viable technologies and tools to measure wellbore geometry in large hole sizes ($>$12-1/4'') while drilling and subsequently the ability to visualize and describe the borehole shape and size in an intuitive way.  A direct mechanical measurement solution such as used on wireline, e.g., multi-finger tools, is not feasible to implement on MWD/LWD tools due to the nature of the drilling operation. Conventional technologies and methods, including acoustic- and density-based measurement methods have been used with reasonable results in smaller hole sizes ($\leq$12-1/4'') when combined with low mud weights. However,many commercially available tools within the industry have low vertical and azimuthal resolution due to sparse sampling or sparse storing in its internal downhole memory of such caliper measurements, resulting in limited use of such data for borehole shape and size purposes. Such conventional technologies and methods have not been, or very seldom used in large hole sizes, primarily due to lack of available technologies and tools, resulting from challenges related to the sensor to wellbore interface standoff distance.  A novel Logging-While-Drilling Caliper tool based on impulse radar technology has been developed to overcome the challenges related to mud weight, sensor to wellbore standoff in oil-based muds and at the same time addressing challenges related to sparse datasets. This tool enables the oil and gas industry to accurately image borehole shape and size with both high vertical and azimuthal resolution, including within large hole sizes where there has not been any viable solution whilst drilling. The high sampling rate together with a large downhole memory (128 GB) allows the industry to evaluate the borehole shape and size as a function of time (time lapse).  An Impulse Radar Caliper tool has been pilot tested in several wells on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS), in borehole sections ranging from 12-1/4'' to 17-1/2''. During the pilot testing, the Impulse Radar Caliper tool acquired wellbore shape and size measurements while drilling, and some intervals while pulling out of hole. Several wellbore features, not previously imaged in such large hole sizes, have been identified and their time-dependent development studied in detail. The results from this pilot campaign are discussed in this paper together with the 3D/4D tunnel-view visualization used to assess the processed caliper measurements.}

	abstract		= {Verification of annular well barrier elements is an essential process during the well construction and plug and abandonment phases. This topic has been the subject of many publications and is governed by regulations in different countries around the world. In this paper we focus on the evaluation of shale creep barriers. We describe how sonic and ultrasonic pulse-echo and pitch-catch configuration data are used to monitor the evolution of formations creep around the casing to eventually form annular barriers.  Multiple annulus logging evaluations were performed across wells from the Valhall, Ula, Alvheim, and Jette fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). This was done using ultrasonic pulse-echo and pitch-catch configuration data as well as traditional sonic logs. The logging data were collected, reprocessed, and compared as part of a collaborative effort between the operator and a service company. In this study we examine the progression of annular solids through time from formation creep.  Our intention was to study the ability of shales creep to form barriers, and to simplify the well design and achieve isolation around the production casing without the need for conventional cementing operations.  The log data provide information of annulus material with a detailed map of the axial and azimuthal variations of the annulus contents. Crossplotting state-of-the-art measurements also helps to identify the material accumulating in the annulus as published in many other industry papers. This approach has garnered interest over the years as a novel solution during well abandonment operations. The results provide solid evidence of shale creep-forming barriers and has been used by the operator to further refine their zonal isolation strategy.  Comparing ultrasonic data with a particular interest on the progression of formation creep, has become a popular subject within the NCS. Innovative use of historical logging data holds a great potential to help make decisions that result in reduced cost and environmental impact. Because of this novel usage and analysis of ultrasonic logging data, the operator was able to make informed decisions faster, saving rig time and cost while reducing the carbon footprint.}

Inefficiency and damaging bit and bottom hole assembly (BHA) vibrations, caused by improper bit and reamer selection when drilling through interbedded formations and formation transitions, are a leading cause of inconsistent performance including excessive torque, low rate of penetration (ROP) and downhole tool failures (DTF). To mitigate vibrations, operators required a comprehensive analysis system/process that would allow them to model the complex BHA interaction in a virtual environment and quantitatively compare the performance of various design scenarios.  To solve the challenge, the drilling team utilized a comprehensive, 4-D finite element model that couples laboratory results with a sophisticated computer simulator that calculates the drilling systemâ€™s dynamic performance from the bit back to surface in a real-time domain. Unlike other modeling programs that assume the contact forces between the cutter and rock, this advanced model utilizes exact cutting structure details coupled with the laboratory-derived rock mechanics to accurately predict the behavior of the bit and reamer with the entire drill string and bottom hole assembly. The effects of each specific BHA component and variations in drilling parameters on vibrations, ROP, and directional tendency can then be quantitatively evaluated.}

Experience has shown that the efficiency of the process depends strongly upon the appropriateness and significance of the data collected. If, for example, a dominant cutter failure mechanism is incorrectly characterized as abrasive wear and is, in fact, impact wear, then the proposed solution and the development time will both be significantly affected.  One method for improving the significance of the data collected is to implement a special-purpose data-acquisition system within the bit. Such a device has at least three significant advantages over available sub-based data-acquisition systems: (1) its bit-based sensors will more accurately detect bit-based events, (2) it can be economically deployed over many bits and (3) it is relatively transparent to the user.  The paper describes an effort to develop, validate, and utilize a bit-based module designed to monitor accelerometer and magnetometer sensors and to record selected data. The authors also describe the effort to infer dynamic dysfunction(s) from the data in the fast-growing hard rock PDC bit application and to mitigate them via modifications to drilling parameters and bit designs.}

	abstract		= {The drilling industry has substantially improved performance based on knowledge from physics-based, statistical, and empirical models of components and systems.  However, most models and source code have been recreated multiple times, which requires significant effort and energy with little additional benefit or step-wise improvements.  The authors propose that it is time to form a coalition of industry and academic leaders to support an open source effort for drilling, to encourage the reuse of continuously improving models and coding efforts.  The vision for this guiding coalition is to 1) set up a repository for source code, data, benchmarks, and documentation, 2) encourage good coding practices, 3) review and comment on the models and data submitted, 4) test, use and improve the code, 5) propose and collect anonymized real data, 6) attract talent and support to the effort, and 7) mentor those getting started.  Those interested to add their time and talent to the cause may publish their results through peer-reviewed literature.  Several online meetings are planned to create this coalition, establish a charter, and layout the guiding principles.  Multiple support avenues are proposed to sustain the effort such as: annual user group meetings, create a SPE Technical Section, and initiating a Joint Industry Program (JIP).  The Open Porous Media Initiative is just one example of how this could be organized and maintained.  As a starting point, this paper reviews existing published drilling models and highlights the similarities and differences for commonly used drillstring hydraulics, dynamics, directional, and bit-rock interaction models.  The key requirements for re-usability of the models and code are: 1) The model itself must be available as open source, well documented with the objective and expected outcomes, include commented code, and shared in a publicly available repository which can be updated, 2) A user's guide must include how to run the core software, how to extend software capabilities, i.e., plug in new features or elements, 3) Include a "theory" manual to explain the fundamental principles, the base equations, any assumptions, and the known limitations, 4) Data examples and formatting requirements to cover a diversity of drilling operations, and 5) Test cases to benchmark the performance and output of different proposed models.  In May 2018 at "The 4th International Colloquium on Non-linear dynamics and control of deep drilling systems," the keynote question was, "Is it time to start using open source models?" The answer is "yes".  Modeling the drilling process is done to help drill a round, ledge free hole, without patterns, with minimum vibration, minimum unplanned dog legs, that reaches all geological targets, in one run per section, and in the least time possible.  An open source repository for drilling will speed up the rate of learning and automation efforts to achieve this goal throughout the entire well execution workflow, including planning, BHA design, real-time operations, and post well analysis.}

	abstract		= {The bit-rock interaction has long been studied to assess PDC drill bit performance, which is driven both by cutting and non-cutting parts of the drill bit. While the cutter-rock interaction has been studied by many authors in the literature, only a few studies have focused on the interaction between the rock and non-cutting parts of the drill bit.  In this paper, we introduce a new method designed to model the interaction between the whole drill bit and the rock formation within a full three-dimensional framework. This approach is based on a generic computational geometry algorithm which simulates the drilling process considering both the drill bit and the hole being drilled as a set of 3D meshed surfaces. The volume of rock removed by the PDC cutters as well as the area and the volume of contact between the rock and the non-cutting parts of the drill bit can be computed with a high accuracy based on the 3D CAD model of the drill bit.  The in-house drill bit simulator implementing this algorithm primarily allows the engineer to estimate how bit-rock interactions distribute between cutting and non-cutting parts of the drill bit and to balance the bit design in the 3D space accordingly over a given range of drilling parameters. This approach has been brought to the field in order to address cutter breakage based on rubbing contacts optimization. Field results associated to some case studies in US shale plays and Canada are described and clearly show that contact points predictions closely match field observations. Moreover, design modifications applied following this process have led to an overall increase in bit performance and bit durability while preventing core-out issues.  The bit design methodology presented in this paper is dedicated to design drill bits whose interaction with the rock formation is predicted with a higher accuracy by accounting for the exact 3D shape of the drill bit.},

	abstract		= {Simulating the mechanical response of PDC drill bits contains a lot of uncertainties. Rock and fluid properties are generally poorly known, complex interactions occur downhole and physical models can hardly capture the full complexity of downhole phenomena. This paper presents a statistical approach that improves the reliability of the PDC bit design optimization process by ensuring that the expected directional behavior of the drill bit is robust over a well-defined range of drilling parameters.  It is first examined how uncertainty propagates through an accurate bit/rock interaction model which simulates numerically the interaction between a given PDC drill bit geometry and a given rock formation, both represented as 3D meshed surfaces. Series of simulations have been launched with simulation parameters defined as probability density functions. The focus has been set on directional drilling simulations where the drill bit is subjected to significant variations in contact loads on gage pads along its trajectory. A global sensitivity analysis has also been performed to identify the key parameters which control drilling performance.  Directional system parameters are critical in terms of steerability and tool face control, particularly in high dogleg severity applications. Based on these simulations, a statistical optimization strategy has then been implemented to ensure that the directional performance of the drill bit remains effective under a given uncertain drilling environment. Statistical analysis combined with drilling simulations indicated that ROP improvements could even be achieved without compromising steerability. A balanced bit design was selected and manufactured in an 8 1/2-in. model to drill a 714 ft section of a Kuwait field. The bit was run on a high dogleg rotary steerable system and directional assembly. The bit achieved the high steerability goals required by the application while showing a good compatibility with the directional tool. Moreover, ROP was increased by approximately 27\% compared to offset wells, setting a record rate of penetration in the field.  Whereas statistical analyses are commonly conducted in the field of geosciences, it has rarely been applied in the field of drilling applications. The statistical bit design optimization strategy deployed in this work has allowed to improve both the drilling performance of the drill bit and its reliability.},

	abstract		= {Observation of cuttings and cavings serves as an important early indicator for hole cleaning and wellbore instability problems. Automation of this critical monitoring process is, however, still in its infancy. This paper highlights the development and initial field testing of a new automated cuttings and cavings monitoring sensor system. Initial challenges identified in an earlier field test, and their solutions that have been incorporated into this new working field prototype, are presented.  The imaging sensors selected for the prototype, including a 3D laser profile scanner and a machine vision camera, were used in an initial field trial to assess the feasibility of building a prototype that can operate in a harsh field environment. Based on that initial field trial, the prototype was built, and preliminary outdoor tests were conducted offsite to validate its performance. Following that, a second field trial at an active drilling site in West Texas was conducted to assess the implementation and performance of the prototype in the field.  Practical solutions to key challenges identified in the first field trial were successfully implemented in the new prototype, and its field performance was validated in the second field trial where the prototype was integrated into the solids control system of an active drilling rig, successfully collecting data for during drilling operations. The system accurately measured the volumetric return of cuttings, and the tests demonstrate the ability to determine the cuttings size distribution and detect anomalous-sized cavings. The results can be used directly for improved hole cleaning management and stuck pipe avoidance in field operations.  This paper introduces the first working prototype of a 3D-imaging cuttings monitoring system that could be taken into production for quantifying the volumetric return of cuttings on surface and providing information about the size and shape of cuttings and cavings. The development of this cuttings sensor is a major milestone in the field of drilling automation, bringing the industry closer to achieving a fully automated hole cleaning and stuck pipe prevention system.}

	abstract		= {This paper describes a new approach to understand the causes of stick-slip vibrations experienced by PDC bits. This new model takes into consideration not only the axial and torsional modes of vibration, but also the coupling between these two modes through bit-rock interaction laws, which are consistent with laboratory results from single cutter experiments. These interaction laws, which account for both frictional contact and cutting processes at the bit-rock interface, are formulated in terms of the depth of cut, a variable that brings into the equations the position of the bit at a previous a priori unknown time. They also account for potential loss of frictional contact between the wear-flats and the rock. The delayed and coupled nature of this interaction is ultimately responsible for the occurrence of self-excited vibrations, which can degenerate into stick-slip oscillations under certain conditions. The features of the torsional vibrations that are predicted with this model are well in accordance with field observations. Furthermore, the results reveal that the model predicts apparent rate effects as an inherent outcome of the nature of the bit-rock interface.}

	abstract		= {There is a growing need for robust and efficient abandonment approaches with many oil and gas reservoirs nearing their economic lifetime. The Through-Tubing Abandonment (TTA) approach can deliver safe, robust and efficient isolation and reduced environmental footprint in keeping with â€˜As Low as Reasonably Practicableâ€™ (ALARP) principles. This paper provides guidance on how to select TTA candidate wells, including wells with gauge cables present in the permanent isolation interval, and provides operational advice to obtain a quality abandonment.  The industry has been abandoning wells via through tubing cementing methods for decades which has resulted in significant progress in the understanding of the applicability of the methodology and commensurate development of suitable technologies to deliver reliable long-term isolation. This paper will present the latest on selection criteria to screen wells for TTA. It will further propose cement placement and verification methods, necessary barrier lengths and risk-based decision making on the acceptability of gauge cables as part of the final permanent well barrier element.  The recent insights in TTA technologies and their use are described. These include demonstrated technologies such as expanding cement and vibration tools to enhance cement placement and options to log and verify the isolations. Testing results on cement sealing with gauge cables incorporated in the cemented annulus are also presented. Furthermore, promising emerging technologies such as methods to centralize the tubing to improve cement placement will be described.  Recent TTA applications in Europe, onshore and offshore, are presented as examples to illustrate current industry experience and the viability and reliability of such approaches.  A generally accepted, safe, robust and reliable approach towards TTA in keeping with ALARP principles common to the industry is pursued within this paper in order to enable acceptance and growth of TTA and associated technologies, and thereby further enable the wider application of rigless abandonment across the industry.}

The study details the technologies, their implementation approach, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of the project.  Technical and procedural measures necessary to ensure the safe and efficient use of the system are explained. The project's measured KPIs were collected and analyzed throughout multiple wells and are presented in the paper to measure the performance and success of the project.  Throughout the execution of the project, the automation platform successfully coordinated control ownership of the two Apps.

	abstract		= {Gas Technology Institute (GTI) has been the leading investigator in the field of high power laser applications research for well construction and completion applications. Since 1997, GTI (then as Gas Research Institute- GRI) has investigated several military and industrial laser systems and their ability to cut and drill into reservoir type rocks. In this report, GTI continues its investigation with a 5.34 kW ytterbium-doped multi-clad high power fiber laser (HPFL). When compared to its competitors; the HPFL represents a technology that is more cost effective to operate, capable of remote operations, and requires considerably less maintenance and repair.  Work performed under this contract included design and implementation of laboratory experiments to investigate the effects of high power laser energy on a variety of rock types. All previous laser/rock interaction tests were performed on samples in the lab at atmospheric pressure. To determine the effect of downhole pressure conditions, a sophisticated tri-axial cell was designed and tested. For the first time, Berea sandstone, limestone and clad core samples were lased under various combinations of confining, axial and pore pressures. Composite core samples consisted of steel cemented to rock in an effort to represent material penetrated in a cased hole. The results of this experiment will assist in the development of a downhole laser perforation or side tracking prototype tool.  To determine how this promising laser would perform under high pressure in-situ conditions, GTI performed a number of experiments with results directly comparable to previous data. Experiments were designed to investigate the effect of laser input parameters on representative reservoir rock types of sandstone and limestone. The focus of the experiments was on laser/rock interaction under confining pressure as would be the case for all drilling and completion operations. As such, the results would be applicable to drilling, perforation, and side tracking applications.  In the past, several combinations of laser and rock variables were investigated at standard conditions and reported in the literature. More recent experiments determined the technical feasibility of laser perforation on multiple samples of rock, cement and steel.  The fiber laser was capable of penetrating these materials under a variety of conditions, to an appropriate depth, and with reasonable energy requirements. It was determined that fiber lasers are capable of cutting rock without causing damage to flow properties.  Furthermore, the laser perforation resulted in permeability improvements on the exposed rock surface.  This report has been prepared in two parts and each part may be treated as a stand-alone document.  Part 1 (High Energy Laser Drilling) includes the general description of the concept and focuses on results from experiments under the ambient lab conditions.  Part 2 (High Energy Laser Perforation and Completion Techniques) discusses the design and development of a customized laser pressure cell; experimental design and procedures, and the resulting data on pressure-charged samples exposed to the laser beam. An analysis provides the resulting effect of downhole pressure conditions on the laser/rock interaction process.}

	abstract		= {Bullheading involves pumping produced fluids back into the formation using a kill-fluid. A key operational parameter is the required bullheading rate which depends on surface pressure, available horsepower, and erosion limits. There is wide variation in current guidelines for bullheading rates, especially for large-diameter wellbores. Therefore, a well-scale bullheading test program was conducted using a 5200-ft-deep vertical well with 9-5/8''x2-7/8'' casing/tubing annulus located at LSU test well facility. The tubing was instrumented with 4 downhole pressure gauges and fiber optic DTS/DAS to obtain data on the downhole flow dynamics and determine bullheading efficiencies. In a typical test, a large nitrogen cap placed at the top of the annulus was bullheaded by pumping fluid in annulus with continuous returns taken from the tubing side. Tests were conducted with varying fluid rates (50 to 500 gpm), initial gas-cap size (30-60 bbl), gas pressurization method and kill fluids (water and synthetic base mud). It was observed that the bullheading process involves simultaneous gas compression, gas bubble breakage, gas dispersion, and gas displacement, unlike the typical assumption of bullheading a large gas slug. The breakage of the initial gas slug depended on the surface pressure and the extent of gas-liquid mixing. The minimum water flowrate required for gas bullheading matched to water velocity just above small bubble velocity in water. Increase in water flowrate increased the bullheading efficiency, e.g., bullheading with 350 gpm required $<$50\% water volume compared to 150 gpm water flowrate. Experiments with a highly pressurized initial gas cap and a larger initial gas cap volume resulted in relatively more efficient bullheading due to lower slip velocity resulting from higher average gas-holdup in the gas-swarm. In one test, the gas was bullheaded for some time and then allowed to migrate upward in a shut-in well. It was observed that the gas migration velocity (0.71 ft/sec) was higher than the gas slip velocity during bullheading (0.3-0.6 ft/sec). Contrary to the popular belief, the gas also did not carry its pressure while migrating in a shut in well. The experimental observation of bubbly flow instead of slug flow during bullheading under sufficiently higher surface pressure helped understand the multiphase flow dynamics of bullheading and it can help provide realistic bullheading guidelines based on well conditions.}

Recent investigations reported by the authors determined that the design of polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits has a significant influence on stick/slip behaviour of the drilling systems. Among various bit design methodologies, a depth-of-cut (DOC) control technique has emerged as an effective way of mitigating bit-induced stick/slip. The research reported in this paper aims at enhancing this technique to accurately identify the optimal application of DOC control for maximum reliability and performance.  A comprehensive testing program on a full-scale research rig was undertaken to characterize the optimal type, positioning, and extent of DOC control required for mitigating stick/slip. Several PDC bits incorporating strategically configured DOC control elements were designed and tested. The stick/slip tendencies of bits were determined based on diagnostics from downhole drilling dynamics monitoring devices while the surface operating parameters were varied in a controlled manner.  Test results indicated that certain DOC control characteristics were the most effective in mitigating stick/slip. While under-application of DOC control did not mitigate stick/slip, over-application reduced performance without mitigating stick/slip. Formation type played a major role in instigating stick/slip, and was a significant factor in designing DOC control.  The paper presents analysis details and proposes design guidelines based on testing in multiple formations within three research wells. These design guidelines are also supported by field evidence from the North Sea, where statistics on many bit runs indicate superior performance with properly tuned DOC control.}

	abstract		= {The wellhead is a pressure containing vessel at the top of well and acts as the mechanical connection between well and blowout preventer (BOP), or Christmas tree. Wellheads in subsea wells are subjected to dynamic loading, and consequently fatigue damage, whenever a riser connects a well to a floating vessel. This paper investigates the load distribution and stresses along the components of subsea wellheads installed in a caisson, as an alternative to mitigate wellhead fatigue.  To prevent fatigue-related incidents, operators, suppliers, and classification societies have collaborated to improve the evaluation of wellhead fatigue. A detailed finite element model (FEM) of the wellhead is used to simulate the mechanical response of the system and calculate stress levels at relevant spots. The simulations presented in this study follow the industry's recommended practices to investigate the potential of reducing the loading on wellhead fatigue hot spots by having a caisson installed around the conductor. Different parameters were established to evaluate the sensitivity of the system's response and determine the optimal mechanical configuration.  Caissons have been used to place the wellhead and the Christmas tree below the mud line level, as a protective measure against icebergs in Arctic regions and trawl nets in fishing areas. The results of the presented study case indicate that this practice may be of benefit to subsea wellheads in general. The interactions with the caisson and the thick cement ring between conductor and caisson near the mud line may alter the response of the wellhead to the environmental loads transferred by the riser. While the magnitude of the loading itself is not reduced, its distribution along the wellhead components is. As a result, stresses on wellhead spots particularly vulnerable to fatigue failure, such as welds, may be reduced, while stresses on other, less vulnerable, locations of the wellhead may increase, which still results in a net gain to the overall service life of the product.  Installation of a subsea wellhead in a caisson is a potential fatigue mitigating measure applicable to new wells, either in satellite or clustered configuration. The industry's established experience with similar equipment may expedite the adoption of this measure.}

A predictive model that links ROP to its influential parameters is essential to optimize ROP for minimizing drilling costs. This study implements a comprehensive data mining approach utilizing Python toolboxes to improve ROP prediction in directional wells, which has not been addressed as much as vertical wells with respect to the downhole weight on the bit (WOB) and cutting transport. To do so, seven functions, including influential parameters, were identified to impact ROP in directional drilling. Drilling data of seven directional wells from an offshore rig in a gas field was compiled to set up the input dataset. The data preprocessing methods, consisting of the modified Z-score and Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing filter, were utilized to remove outliers and reduce the noises in the input dataset. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and random forest regression models were employed comparatively to predict ROP, and their architectures were designed by tuning hyperparameters of the models. The models' accuracy was statistically and graphically assessed by using the K-fold cross-validation and statistical metrics. The random forest model was demonstrated to be superior to the MLP neural network model in terms of accuracy and speed. The results represent that using calculated downhole WOB instead of measured surface WOB in the input dataset reinforces the models' accuracy in the prediction of ROP. Statistical investigations such as partial correlation, mutual information, and permutation feature importance revealed that the cutting transport function can affect ROP in directional drilling as significantly as other influential parameters, which has not been mainly accounted for in the literature when establishing models for ROP prediction.}

	abstract		= {A drill bit is subjected to rotational speed variation during drilling, ranging from minor rotational speed oscillations to severe speed variation, including stuck phase. The severe speed variation, referred to as stick-slip, is known to be a major source of problems, such as fatigue failures, bit wear, and poor drilling rates. This paper will provide new insight into the mechanisms that drive severe stick-slip based on continuous high-frequency downhole measurements and 3D transient dynamic drilling simulation.  To understand the mechanism of severe stick-slip, a series of drilling tests were conducted at a full-scale drilling test facility. An advanced downhole measurement tool was placed in the bottom hole assembly (BHA) to record three-axis shock and vibration, RPM, bending moment, downhole weight on bit (DWOB), downhole torque (DTOR) and internal and annular pressure at high frequency. The drilling system was then modeled on a 3D transient drilling simulation platform, including detailed bit-rock interaction based on single-cutter tests, the exact BHA, and the wellbore geometry.  The downhole recorded data showed clear coupling of severe stick-slip, axial load, and bending moment conditions. Interesting patterns observed between RPM, DWOB, DTOR, and bending moment will be presented in detail. The recorded severe stick-slip condition was successfully reproduced by 3D transient dynamic simulation, and the torque, axial load, and bending moment variations along the BHA revealed coupling between torsional, axial, and lateral motions of the drilling system from simulation. Bit-rock interaction and drillstring-wellbore contact are the drivers supporting the coupling. It was found that the coupling of three motions of the drilling system is the most reasonable explanation to the self-sustained severe stick-slip condition. This mechanism can explain the field observed stick-slip trend (i.e., the higher WOB and lower RPM tend to increase the risk of severe stick-slip tendency). Downhole measurements and transient 3D dynamic simulation of the entire drilling system are essential to fully understand this mechanism.  Understanding the stick-slip process opens additional opportunities for controlling severe stick-slip. Because the stick-slip mechanism is driven by the coupling of three motions, it is possible to mitigate this condition by breaking the coupling mechanism. For example, a shock sub possibly will reduce the severity of axial coupling due to added axial compliance. Simulation shows breaking the mechanism could reduce the severity of stick-slip. The study being reported in this paper also proved the validity of applying advanced 3D transient dynamic model to obtain a better understanding of drilling system behavior. Drilling simulation might well be an effective way to plan a drilling system and drilling parameters.}

A series of examples, ranging from simple drillstring and fluids models to coupled drillstring dynamics models are included. They demonstrate the coding styles, validation, and verification necessary to submit a model to the repository. These models include a torsional drillstring model, a coupled axial-torsional drillstring dynamics model with integrated control system responses, an advanced fluid model for drilling fluids, and a bottomhole assembly dynamics model. The drillstring modelling and overall optimization communities are invited to make use of these models and contribute their own to create an active ecosystem that promotes progress.}

	abstract		= {With Casing drilling, the casing movement creates interaction with the formation that positively affects how the well is drilled. The casing works as a mechanical tool to plaster the cuttings into the formation face and further harden it by physical contact. The small annulus and pipe rotation creates a powerful centrifugal force that helps distribute the cuttings and seals pore spaces which helps in reducing fluid losses.  Therefore, the uniform orbital motion of casing is a crucial factor to obtain smearing effect. Hence, the current study was undertaken to determine the drilling conditions that lead to a uniform whirling motion for simulating plastering effect while also avoiding conditions that may lead to detrimental vibrations encountered in backward whirling. This study consists of analytical modelling, numerical simulations and preliminary experimental investigations.  A comprehensive analytical model was developed to predict the whirling motion of a rotating casing. The model is close to realistic condition as it considers the effect of different factors of whirling motion including eccentricity, gravity, contact forces and fluid interaction. This model was used to perform a parametric study to determine how different factors affect the whirling speed, also known as the critical speed, of casing drilling assembly.  An energy method was used to develop expressions for critical whirling speed. A parametric study was performed using the kinematic model as well as the energy method to see how different factors affect whirling motion.  Based on the parametric study, it was seen that the critical factors that affect backward whirling motion are contact forces or friction forces. Therefore, it is very important to have an estimate of the side force and coefficient of friction values in order to predict the critical whirling speed of backward whirling phenomena. A simulator based on the transfer matrix method was developed to determine the side forces and contact forces of a complex BHA, which are quite often the sweet spots of backward whirling. The simulator can also be used to get the static deflection profile which can be used to compute the critical whirling speed.  In addition to the static state vectors, we need to find the dynamic state vectors that describe the response of the BHA assembly to the specified excitation for the specified RPM, WOB and other operating parameters. These state vectors can be used for designing BHA so that they are less prone to backward whirling. Therefore, a transfer matrix model was developed for the dynamic Euler equation. Some preliminary experimental tests were performed to evaluate the analytical model.},

	abstract		= {Utilizing big drilling data requires an innovative approach. The service companyâ€™s drill bits business is largely based upon an in-house drilling record system (DRS) that captures global bit record performance data. The DRS contains over 1.8 million wells drilled worldwide since 1980 with nearly 5.4 million total BHA runs from over 100 countries. In the last 10 years alone, over 1.4 million bit runs drilling over 2.8 billion ft of formation have been recorded. To utilize this vast amount of data for drill bit performance evaluation, analysis, and monitoring, the innovative approach described in this paper was developed and implemented.  Traditionally, the performance of a drill bit run\textendash{}often measured in terms of drilled footage and ROP\textendash{}has been evaluated versus similar offset runs. Offset runs are chosen in various ways, but are typically done manually by bit engineers, meaning that offset run selection is subjective based on personal experience and bias. Furthermore, people often only evaluate the performance of test bit designs. Instead, we wanted to analyze and monitor the performance of all drill bit runs. To alleviate these biases and enable a wider breadth of considered runs, an objective offset run selection workflow was developed and implemented within DRS. Offset runs are selected based on a sophisticated filtering and scoring routine that considers many characteristics such as geographic location, time, wellbore and drilling system design, along with lithology. As new data enters DRS continuously, this workflow runs on a regular basis using an automated pipeline.  The performance evaluation results of the automated offset selection workflow are available to all data analysts (engineers and salespeople) both inside DRS and extensible applications to aid in performance monitoring and new product development target-setting. Product performance is now objectively evaluated at-scale across geographies and always utilizing apples-to-apples comparisons. The workflow has proven itself quite useful and delivered business value already but also exemplifies the need for both enhanced data quality and improved bit record data capture rate. These are ongoing efforts to further enhance and improve this workflow.  Automated workflows like this one can help our industry by eliminating repetitive biased tasks and allowing people to focus on more creative processes leveraging objective data. Developing new drill bit designs, material selections, or component selections to overcome new challenges are creative processes which contribute to increased drilling performance and lower costs for the industry.}

A field testing program was carried out on a full-scale experimental test rig in the state of Oklahoma, USA, with known lithological formations, in order to evaluate underreaming system designs. In this context, the underreaming system comprised the bit, the drive system, and the underreaming element.  To fully understand how the system interacts with the formation and reacts to inputs from the surface, drilling mechanics measurements were taken above and below the reamer element. Drilling dynamics measurements were also taken at three places in the BHA, with two drilling dynamics packages spaced out below the reamer and one positioned directly above it. That way, dynamics on the bit and reamer could be studied separately to understand how bit and reamer performance affect each other and the overall system dynamics.  The first well was directionally drilled with a rotary steerable system, concentric reamer, and vibration monitoring equipment set up in an industry-standard arrangement. This paper will describe how the findings and learning from the initial field test led to bit redesign and operational techniques implemented to enhance the drilling system stability. Another borehole was then drilled through identical formations with this improved system, offering a unique detailed comparison between the two field tests. The new bit design allowed the bit to control the drilling rate with better weight distribution between bit and reamer, significantly reducing vibration, and in this study, without impacting penetration rate.  A concentric reaming tool new to the drilling industry was used in both wells as a part of this study and will also be described. This tool demonstrated good steerability with a rotary steerable tool system and operated properly, drilling closed, activating, reaming, and finally, closing for retrieval from the hole.}

This paper presents the results of comparing such a model to laboratory drilling tests for four radically different bit designs in four different rocks. The geometry of each cutter on the bit was determined by detailed measurements of the bit with a 3-axis coordinate measuring machine.  Drilling tests were conducted by ``reaming" rock with an 8-1/2" bit that had been previously drilled with a 6-1/4'' bit. Only the peripheral cutters engaged the rock during the reaming. Additional tests were conducted where the WOB and torque were recorded while drilling a pilot hole into the top of a flat rock and drilling through two different bed boundaries with constant ROP. The model predictions compared well to the measured data for both the reaming tests and the pilot hole tests.},

	abstract		= {Appropriate selection of a bottom-hole assembly (BHA) is critical to the success of a drilling operation.  In US Land drilling, these assemblies are often selected using local heuristics rather than rigorous analysis. These heuristics are frequently derived from the incentives of the directional contractor as opposed to incentives for the operator. Large motor bends enable more rotation though the curve and reduce the possibility of tripping for build rates. Unstabilized motors are believed to aid sliding and tool face control. Both of these practices lead to drilling a more tortuous wellbore and may cause problems later in the wellâ€™s life. This study quantifies the impact of these practices and proposes alternatives that can balance the needs of directional companies with the desire of operators for high-quality wellbores. Over 60 conventional motor assemblies used to drill curves in the Eagle Ford and Permian were analyzed for directional performance using commercial drillstring analysis software. The sliding and rotary tendencies were modelled through the curve across a range of potential drilling conditions. Expected build-rate models were validated by comparison to the maximum achieved doglegs in the directional surveys. When available, additional validation was performed using motor yields calculated from slide sheets. The validated models were compared to the dogleg severity requirements for each assemblyâ€™s respective well plan. Comparisons of slide ratios and slide/rotate tendencies of the BHAs were used to estimate the impact on wellbore quality using the tortuosity metric proposed by Jamieson (2019).  Typical well plans for both basins had curves of 10 degrees/100ft with no well plan greater than 12 degrees/100ft. Typical bottom hole assemblies were capable of $>$15 degrees/100ft under normal sliding conditions, with some assemblies capable of $>$20 degrees/100ft of build. Predicted build rates were validated by slide sheets and observed dogleg severities. Common characteristics among assemblies with excess capacity were high bend angles ($>=$2 degrees) and minimal stabilization. These slick assemblies also had a strong drop tendency in rotation at low inclinations. The combination of high-build rate with rotary drop greatly increases tortuosity, particularly in the early stages of well. A minority of the assemblies used a lower motor bend angle ($<$2 degrees) combined with multiple stabilizers. These assemblies had a more consistent directional capability throughout the curve and held angle in rotation. The success of these assemblies confirms that a higher quality wellbore with an improved BHA design is technically achievable.  As increasing attention is afforded to the topic of wellbore quality it is important to have methods available to technically achieve high-quality wellbores.  In addition to the management of drilling practices, it is also important to have an appropriate BHA design that can enable those practices.},

	abstract		= {A new mathematical model is developed for the nonlinear-static, linearized-dynamic, and fully nonlinear-dynamic behavior of drillstrings in arbitrary wellbore profiles. The formulation is based on a three-dimensional nonlinear finite beam element and accounts for the fully coupled flexibility of the drillstring, geometric nonlinearity (large displacement, small strain), automatic determination of wellbore contact points, friction acting between the drillstring and the wellbore, stabilizer clearance, three-dimensional wellbore profiles, added fluid mass and damping effects from the hydrodynamic forces generated between the drillstring and surrounding fluid, complex tool geometry (including steerable mud motors, rotary steerable systems, and eccentric stabilizers/components), shear beam deformations, lateral rotary inertias, and gyroscopic effects. The resulting model is numerically validated through comparisons with analytical formulas and previous nonlinear models, showing that it can readily be applied to a wide range of drilling engineering problems and used for practical analysis. Additionally, individual contributions of shear deformations, lateral rotary inertias, and gyroscopic effects are definitively shown to be insignificant when calculating the static and dynamic behavior of horizontal drilling assemblies within the rotational speed range of most drilling applications. An initial comparison with field data is also provided, which shows the practicality of the developed algorithms in predicting the characteristics of real drilling scenarios. The model is then adjusted and applied to the specific case of inducing lateral vibrations in unconventional horizontal wells. It is proposed that exciting a lateral resonance in the drill pipe lying on the low side of a horizontal wellbore can induce enough movement to help overcome parasitic axial drag acting on a drillstring. This, in turn, would help to increase weight transfer to the bit while slide-drilling with a steerable mud motor in long lateral sections of a wellbore. The change in this lateral resonant behavior due to variations in weight-on-bit (WOB), inclination, well path curvature, wellbore diameter, fluid properties, and tubular dimensions are clearly shown through linearized-dynamic sensitivity studies. Nonlinear time-domain simulations are also performed to better understand the limitations of linearized-dynamic modeling and to provide a more detailed assessment of how inducing lateral vibration influences the WOB while drilling. It is shown that induced lateral vibrations provide a noticeable dynamic WOB of up to \pm{} 250 lbf about the static value, and a slight increase in the average WOB value of up to 150 lbf. The effects on WOB are dependent on the excitation frequency of the induced lateral vibrations, with the greatest benefits being seen at resonant conditions.}

We assess two open-source soft-string dynamic models: the distributed, torsional model by Aarsnes and Shor, and the lumped-mass, coupled axial-torsional model by Dixit et al. Both models are evaluated through six progressively complex test cases designed to enhance methodology development for future model comparisons. Despite their different assumptions and mathematical foundations, both models demonstrated similar responses in drill string vibrations and stick-slip behaviors, with minor differences attributed to the use of distinct friction models (Coulomb versus Stribeck). The study also illustrates the benefits of open-source software in drilling dynamics, such as ease of modification and problem-solving speed, highlighting its potential for improving productivity and insights when combined with collaborative efforts from various industries and academic entities. This work lays the groundwork for further research and robust comparisons of drilling dynamics models, enhancing confidence in both open and closed-source models.}

	abstract		= {Two open-source drillstring models were evaluated on a series of test cases. The first is the distributed, torsional model of Aarsnes and Shor. The second is the lumped-mass, coupled axial-torsional model of Dixit, et al. These models were compared using specially developed test cases that varied in complexity, aiding in debugging differences in the results. Although the modelsâ€™ mathematical derivations were very different, the results showed strong alignment in predicting stick-slip behavior and frequency. In cases of slight variation, access to multiple models and source code allowed a means to locate the origins of the discrepancies. The project served as a pilot study for using opensource software in drilling dynamics, demonstrating its advantages for model improvement, debugging, and accelerated learning.}

	abstract		= {The soft string model has been widely used for torque and drag calculations. Although several modifications have been developed, the standard model in the oil and gas industry is the static soft string model, in which the string is assumed to be motionless and its stiffness is neglected. In order to estimate more realistic and accurate calculation of drillstring loading, not only the acceleration, but also axial stiffness of the string must be considered in force calculations. In this paper, a dynamic, axially-stiff string model is presented for force calculations of drillstring in tripping operations.  The mathematical model is developed to include axial stiffness of the drillstring and acceleration into the soft string model by coupling mass-spring system with the soft string model. Moreover, static friction and drilling fluid drag are taken into account. The drillstring is considered to be a system of coupled oscillators subject to external forces. Then, the motion of the individual oscillator is governed by external forces and the forces applied by its two neighboring elements. In this model, the static friction effect is included as a constraint for initiation of motion.  The drillstring configuration is considered to be drillpipe, drillcollar, and directional assembly. The developed model ("new model") is implemented for tripping-out one stand in two ideal directional wellbores plus one field case wellbore trajectory. Axial force behavior shows a trend of acceleration that is similar to that observed with the previous dynamic soft string model ("previous model": SPE-173084-MS), and the first peak contains the effect of static friction. Displacement at the end of the string shows that the whole drillstring is in motion after few seconds. The axial force using the new model is compared to that (axial force) calculated using the previous model for two different cases. In the acceleration part of the motion, the new model shows a peak about 12\\% higher than the maximum load in the previous model which is due to the static friction force. In the constant velocity part of the motion, depending on the amount of damping, the new model can show a result similar to that of the previous model.  The new dynamic axially-stiff string model provides a more realistic prediction of hookload, and consequently more realistic loading of the hoisting equipment and fatigue life of the drillstring. Other applications of this model are for wellbore planning, drillstring design, optimization and automation of tripping operations.}

	abstract		= {This paper describes an alternative formulation of the nonlinear equations governing the coupled axial and torsional dynamics of a discrete model of a rotary drilling system equipped with a drag bit. This model assumes a rate-independent bit/rock interface law that accounts for both cutting and frictional contact processes. The regenerative effect associated with the cutting introduces a term with delay, and thus a feedback, in the equations of motion, while the frictional contact results in set-valued contact forces and discontinuities in the boundary conditions, which are responsible for the occurrence of axial and torsional stick-slip oscillations. Inspired by P. Wahi and A. Chatterjee (Self-interrupted regenerative metal cutting in turning, International Journal of Non-Linear Mechanics 43:2, 111â€“123, 2008), the regenerative effect is captured by a bit trajectory function, whose evolution is governed by a first order partial differential equation. With this approach, the original state-dependent delay differential equations (SDDDEs) governing the dynamics of the discrete model are replaced by the partial differential equation of the bit trajectory function together with the axial and angular equations of motion of the two degrees-of-freedom model. The equation governing the evolution of the bit trajectory function is further approximated by a system of first order ordinary differential equations through application of the Galerkin method. The introduction of the bit trajectory function makes it possible to consider a bit with two state-dependent delays (and in principle multiple delays) without reducing the computational efficiency. The accuracy of this approximation is validated using published results, and the convergence and robustness properties of the proposed method are analyzed using three cases corresponding to different regimes of instability. Finally, we extend the discrete model to a more generic lumped-parameter model with multiple degrees-of-freedom, which captures the propagation of axial and torsional vibrations along the drillstring.}

	abstract		= {The parallel track scraping principle of conventional PDC bits largely limits the cutting efficiency and working life in deep formations. Cross-cutting polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit may be an efficient drilling tool that increases the rock-breaking efficiency through both cross-cutting and alternate-cutting modes of the PDC cutter. The motion track equation of the cross-cutting PDC bit was derived by using the compound coordinate system, and the motion track was analyzed. Meanwhile, through the unit experiment and discrete element simulation, the cutting force, volume-specific load, and crack propagation were analyzed under different cutting modes. Through establishing a nonlinear dynamic model of the bit-rock system, the speed-up mechanism of the novel bit was analyzed based on rock damage, rock stress state, and motion characteristic of the bit during the rock-breaking process. Compared with unidirectional cutting, cross-cutting produces less cutting force, more brittle fracture, and a greater decrease of formation strength. The novel PDC bit can put more rock elements into a tensile stress condition than a conventional PDC bit, and the plastic energy dissipation ratio of the cross-cutting PDC bit is lower while the damage energy consumption ratio is higher than they are for conventional bits, which is beneficial to increasing the ratio of fracture failure and improving rock-breaking efficiency. Laboratory drilling tests show that the cross-cutting PDC bit can create mesh-like bottom-hole features. Drilling contrast experiments show that a mesh-like bottom-hole pattern can be obtained by using the cross-cutting PDC bit, of which the ROP is obviously higher than that of the conventional bit when drilling in sandstone or limestone formation. Meanwhile, the influence of deviation angle, weight on bit, and rock properties on cutting efficiency of the cross-cutting PDC bit are studied.}

	abstract		= {Drilling is an essential operation for subsurface hydrocarbon/geothermal energy extraction or underground waste fluid/gas storage. Efficient drilling is the key to an economically viable operation. Axial, torsional, and lateral oscillations that are excited in the drillstring by various surface/downhole sources (like the application of the weight-on-bit (WOB), rock cutting process, bottom-hole-assembly (BHA) resonance, downhole tool operation, drilling fluid dynamics, etc.), are the prime causes of downhole tool failure, material fatigue, bit wear/damage, and insufficient surface-to-bottom energy transfer. Since the 1960s, a wide variety of models have been developed to analyze drillstring dynamics and optimize the well/drillstring design. With the advance of drilling engineering, sensor technology, and data science, a fast and comprehensive drilling system dynamic model is in need for real-time drilling optimization and automation.  In this study, a control-oriented physics-based lumped parameter model (LPM) is developed to investigate the fully coupled drillstring dynamics in all three directions. Various boundary conditions (wellbore-drillstring interaction, bit-rock interaction, presence of stabilizers/centralizers) and system input actuations (surface WOB/hookload, surface rotational speed (RPM)/torque, mud motor operational parameters, etc.) are defined in the modeling framework. Simulations are run for different drillstring scenarios in a vertical and an actual L-shaped wellbore configuration. System dynamic responses illustrate various amplitudes, frequencies, and modes of fully coupled drillstring vibrations at different depths when simulated with different drilling parameters. Another significant observation is the emergence, propagation, and transition of lateral vibration modes between forward, backward, and chaotic whirl patterns. Based on the tradeoff between accuracy and complexity, the proposed dynamic model can be adapted for real-time model-based control, and can also be deployed for well design purposes or digital twinning applications.}
